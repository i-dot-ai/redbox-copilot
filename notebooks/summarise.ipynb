Appeals to the Cabinet should be infrequent, and Ministers chairing Cabinet Committees should exercise discretion in advising the prime minister whether to allow them. To support the principle of collective responsibility by ensuring that, even though a question may never reach the Cabinet itself, it will be fully considered. In this way, the ﬁnal judgement is sufﬁcientlyauthoritative that Government as a whole can be expected to accept responsibility for it. In this sense, Cabinet Committee decisions have the same authority as Cabinet decisions.BuildingsThe main building of the Cabinet Office is at 70 Whitehall, adjacent to Downing Street. The building connects three historically distinct properties, as well as the remains of Henry VIII\\'s 1530 tennis courts, part of the Palace of Whitehall, which can be seen within the building. The Whitehall frontage was designed by Sir John Soane and completed by Sir Charles Barry between 1845 and 1847 as the Treasury Buildings. Immediately to the west Dorset House (1700) connects the front of the building toWilliam Kent\\'s Treasury (1733–36), which faces outThe entrance to the Cabinet Ofﬁce.\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Ofﬁce\\n\\n4/6\\n\\n03/10/2023, 19:52\\n\\nCabinet Ofﬁce - Wikipediaonto Horse Guards Parade. The latter is built over the site of the Cockpit, used for cock fighting in the Tudor period, and subsequently as a theatre. In the early 1960s the buildings were restored and many of the Tudor remains were exposed and repaired. Significant renovations between 2010 and 2016 converted many of the floors to open plan and created new office space. The Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms are located on this site.The department occupies other buildings in Whitehall and the surrounding area, including part of 1 Horse Guards, as well as sites in other parts of the country.\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nBritish Civil Service Cabinet Ofﬁce Brieﬁng Rooms Prime Minister\\'s Strategy Unit Social Exclusion Task Force United Kingdom budgetReferences\\n\\n1. \"Civil service employment – Table 9, Row 23\" (https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourm arket/peopleinwork/publicsectorpersonnel/datasets/publicsectoremploymentreferencetable).
