On the other hand, since Influence markers are already present, he could use any remaining operation points to strengthen South Korea or its neighboring countries.\\\\n\\\\n6.1.4 Influence markers may always be placed in any country that is adjacent (connected) to the phasing player’s superpower space.\\\\n\\\\nEXAMPLE: The US player has 2 Influence markers in Turkey and the USSR player has none. Therefore, the US controls Turkey. The USSR player uses a 4 Operations point card to place Influence markers. When placing markers in Turkey, the first marker costs 2 Operations points. However, after placement of the first USSR influence marker, the US no longer exceeds USSR influence in Turkey by the Stability Number of 2, thus, a second or third Soviet influence marker would only cost 1 operation point per marker. If the US player started with only 1 influence marker in Turkey, the US player would not control Turkey. Therefore, any Soviet influence placement would only cost 1 operations point per marker.\\\\n\\\\n6.1.5 Influence markers are treated like cash. Players may ‘break’ a large denomination into smaller denominations at any time. Additionally, the number of Influence markers included in the game is not an absolute limit. Small poker chips, coins or wooden blocks can be utilized to substitute in the event of a marker shortage.\\\\n\\\\n6.1.6 If a player has two or more markers in a country, place the larger denomination on top. Influence markers are open to inspection at all times.\\\\n\\\\n6.2 REALIGNMENT ROLLS 6.2.1 Realignment rolls are used to reduce enemy Influence in a country. To attempt a Realignment roll, the acting player need not have any Influence in the target country or in any adjacent country—although this improves the chance of success greatly. When using a card for Realignment rolls, the player may resolve each roll before declaring the next target. Countries may be tar- geted for Realignment more than once per Action Round.\\\\n\\\\n6.2.2 It costs one Operations point to make a Realignment roll. Each player rolls a die and the high roller may remove the dif- ference between the rolls from their opponent’s Influence in the target country. Ties are considered a draw, and no markers are removed. Each player modifies his die roll:\\\\n\\\\n+\\\\x18 for each adjacent controlled country,\\\\n\\\\nEXAMPLE: The US player controls Turkey and Greece and the USSR player controls Syria and Lebanon. Neither player controls Romania and Bulgaria\\\\n\\\\n+1 if they have more Influence in the target country than their opponent,\\\\n\\\\n+\\\\x18 if your Superpower is adjacent to the target country.\\\\n\\\\n© 2007 GMT Games, LLC\\\\n\\\\nTwilight Struggle —2nd Edition—' metadata={'source': 'local'}\"}], 'temperature': 1, 'n': 1, 'stream': False, 'max_tokens': 256, 'extra_body': {}}'\n",

These Events may be played regardless of the absence of either player’s influence points in either the attacking or defending countries. If there is no influence at risk in the war, the Event’s player still receives victory points upon success, and required military operations irrespective of success (see 8.2.4)\\\\n\\\\n7.3 Permanent Events: Some Event cards have an underlined title, e.g. Flower Power. This indicates that the effects of these Events last for the duration of the game. When such cards are played as Events, place them to the side of the map, or place their markers on the Turn Track, as a reminder of their ongoing effects.\\\\n\\\\n8.0 DEFCON STATUS AND MILITARY OPERATIONS “Strange game. The only winning move is not to play.” —“Joshua” the N.O.R.A.D computer from Wargames.\\\\n\\\\n7.4 Some event cards modify the Operations value of cards that follow. These modifiers should be applied in aggregate, and can modify ‘The China Card’.\\\\n\\\\nEXAMPLE: The US player plays the Red Scare/Purge event during the Headline Phase. Ordinarily, all USSR cards would subtract one from their Operations value. However, for his Headline card, the USSR played Vietnam Revolts. This event gives the Soviet player +1 to all operations played in SE Asia. For his first play, the USSR chooses ‘The China Card’. He plays all points in SE Asia for 5 operations points. This is modified by the Vietnam Revolts card, giving the USSR player 6 operation points. However, the US Red Scare/Purge card brings the total down to 5 operations points.\\\\n\\\\n8.1 The DEFCON Track 8.1.1 DEFCON status measures nuclear tension in the game. The DEFCON level begins the game at its maximum ‘peace’ level of 5. It can go down and back up due to events and actions by the players, but if, at any point, it decreases to \\\\x18, the game ends immediately.\\\\n\\\\n8.1.2 The DEFCON status may never Improve above 5. Any event that would Improve the DEFCON status above 5 has no DEFCON effect.\\\\n\\\\n8.1.3 If DEFCON \\\\x18 status is reached, nuclear war breaks out and the game ends immediately. The phasing player is responsible for the status marker moving to DEFCON \\\\x18, and loses the game.\\\\n\\\\n7.4.1 Events modifying the Operations value of a card only apply to one player. The modifier is not transferable to their opponent by virtue of a card taken from their opponent’s hand.\\\\n\\\\nEXAMPLE: The US player plays Olympic Games, and the DE- FCON status is at 2. The USSR player boycotts the game. The\\\\n\\\\nEXAMPLE: The USSR player has played ‘Brezhnev Doctrine’ as an Event, and therefore receives a +1 Operations value modifier for all of his cards. If the US player steals one of his cards, for example by playing ‘Grain Sales to the Soviets’, the US player does not benefit from a +1 Operations value modifier on that card.\\\\n\\\\n© 2007 GMT Games, LLC\\\\n\\\\nTwilight Struggle —2nd Edition—\\\\n\\\\nDEFCON status is degraded to level 1, and nuclear war is trig- gered. The US player, as the phasing player, has lost.\\\\n\\\\n8.1.4 Any Coup attempt in a Battleground country degrades the DEFCON status one level.\\\\n\\\\n8.2.4 If a player uses a card for Operations points, and thereby triggers a War Event associated with his opponent, his opponent’s Military marker is moved on the Military Operations track as directed by the Event text.\\\\n\\\\n8.1.5 The consequences of the DEFCON status levels are on the DEFCON Track, and are reproduced here:\\\\n\\\\nDEFCON 5: No effect\\\\n\\\\nDEFCON 4: No Coup or Realignment rolls are permitted in Europe.\\\\n\\\\nEXAMPLE: The US player uses the ‘Arab-Israeli War’ card for Operations points, thereby also triggering the War Event (as it is associated with the Soviet Union player). In addition to the Event taking place as directed on the card, the USSR player moves his Military Operations marker two spaces on the Military Operations track.' metadata={'source': 'local'}\"}], 'temperature': 1, 'n': 1, 'stream': False, 'max_tokens': 256, 'extra_body': {}}'\n",

Reaching 20 VPs does not result in Automatic Victory during scoring at the end of turn \\\\x180; however, Control of Europe\\\\n\\\\n© 2007 GMT Games, LLC\\\\n\\\\nTwilight Struggle —2nd Edition—\\\\n\\\\ndoes grant automatic victory to the controlling player, regardless of scoring elsewhere.\\\\n\\\\nOnce all regions have been scored, victory goes to the player who has accrued most VPs. If the VP marker is on a positive number, the US wins; if the VP marker is on a negative number, the USSR wins. If the VP marker is on zero, the game ends in a draw.\\\\n\\\\n12.2 Control The Soviet Union must place three Influence on the Chinese Civil War space to Control it. Soviet Influence is placed in the Chinese Civil War space according to the rules for placing influ- ence in countries (see 6.\\\\x18). If the China card remains unclaimed throughout the game, no player receives the victory point for possession of the China Card during end game scoring.\\\\n\\\\n11.0 TOURNAMENT PLAY These rules are optional, and are not required for ‘friendly’ play. They are simply offered as guidelines on conducting Twilight Struggle as a competitive tournament game.\\\\n\\\\n11.1.1 During tournament play, all cards held at the end of the round should be revealed to your opponent. This prevents ac- cidental or deliberate holding of scoring cards.\\\\n\\\\n12.3 Impact of Control Until the Soviet Player has placed 3 Influence Points on the Chinese Civil War space, the China Card is in no player’s pos- session. Once the Soviet player had placed 3 Influence Points into the space, the player immediately receives the China Card face up and ready for play. Additionally, the ban on play of the Red Scare/Purge and Formosan Resolution events is immedi- ately lifted.\\\\n\\\\n11.1.2 Any player found holding a scoring card during the Reveal Held Card phase is said to have started an accidental nuclear war, and loses immediately.\\\\n\\\\n11.1.3 During tournament play, the Soviet player should receive the first card of every deal. The deal should alternate back and forth between the players until they have received their full hand size. A player may receive consecutive cards in a deal if they require more cards than their opponent.\\\\n\\\\n12.4 Event Restrictions Until the Soviet player has placed 3 Influence Points on the Chinese Civil War space, the Soviet player may not play Red ScaRe/PuRge nor cultuRal Revolution as events. Additionally, the US player may not play Formosan Resolution as an event. These cards may be played for Operations Points normally.\\\\n\\\\n12.4.1 Special US Condition: For the purposes of playing uS- SuRi RiveR SkiRmiSh or nixon PlayS the china caRd as events, the US is deemed to be in possession of the China Card if the Soviet Player has not yet placed the 3 Influence Points on the Chinese Civil War space.\\\\n\\\\n12.0 THE CHINESE CIVIL WAR VARIANT The Chinese Civil War Variant is meant to be played within the context of the existing rules regarding the China Card (see 9.0). However, where these rules conflict with existing rules or event card text, this section of the rules takes precedence.\\\\n\\\\n12.4.2 Until the Soviet Player has placed 3 Influence Points on the Chinese Civil War space the Russian player subtracts an additional \\\\x18 when rolling for the resolution of the koRean WaR event.\\\\n\\\\n12.4.3 Events made unplayable or restricted due to \\\\x182.4 are still playable for Operations points as per rule 7.5.' metadata={'source': 'local'}\"}], 'temperature': 1, 'n': 1, 'stream': False, 'max_tokens': 256, 'extra_body': {}}'\n",

Iran is the linchpin to the US position to the Middle East and ultimately to the South Asian prizes of Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. Because of the extra influence from the starting bid, it takes a larger card to ensure success. Chris does so with a big roll.

Doing so requires players to stop reacting, and engage in a little planning. That’s exactly what Stefan is trying to do.\\\\n\\\\nAmericans.

In the event of a tie, the US Card is implemented first.\\\\n\\\\nStefan has made a risky choice by playing the Mideast Scoring card right off the bat. Had the Soviets played a headline card that allowed them to place Influence, those IPs would certainly have plopped down in the Mideast making this stealth play a potential nightmare. Unfortunately for Chris, his headline card is a non- threatening effort to nail a couple of early victory points.\\\\n\\\\nUS Setup: 2 IP to West Germany (2/0), 4 IP to Italy (4C/0), 1 IP to France (1/0); Bonus Bid = \\\\x18 IP to Iran (2C/0), 2 IP to France (3C/0), 2 IP to West Germany (4C/0).\\\\n\\\\nThe US Scores 4 for the Mideast Scoring (control of Iran) and the Soviets win the first post-war Olympics. The net result is US +2.\\\\n\\\\nThis is a fairly standard setup. Note that the decision on where to put your starting influence is made AFTER you examine your starting hand. The Soviets have locked down Poland and East Germany. They’ve put 1 Influence in Yugoslavia to threaten Italy and Greece. That 1 IP is always a risk, as it can be flipped by Independent Reds.\\\\n\\\\nAction Rounds USSR Action Round 1: NATO (4 Ops) to Coup Iran. Rolls 6, US influence = 0, Soviet Influence 4. Soviets gain 4 Mil Ops, and DEFCON drops to 4.\\\\n\\\\nThis is the classical opening move. Iran is the linchpin to the US position to the Middle East and ultimately to the South Asian prizes of Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. Because of the extra influence from the starting bid, it takes a larger card to ensure success. Chris does so with a big roll. Mr. Truman must be asleep at the wheel while the dominoes are falling.\\\\n\\\\nUS Action Round 1: FoRmoSan ReSolu- tion (2 Ops) as Influence points.

Without an interesting event, the Soviet player can only deal with one of these problems via a coup. The South American play is an illustration of mid-term planning.

Doing so requires players to stop reacting, and engage in a little planning. That’s exactly what Stefan is trying to do.\\\\n\\\\nAmericans.

He has not really contested Stefan’s Domination of Europe. But he is keenly interested in all that oil! The US knock an Influence point out of Romania (0/2), Poland (0/3C) and East Germany (0/3C). Only the East German point is restored.\\\\n\\\\nChris has played it well here as DEFCON is already at 2.

But taking a 4 Op out of the US deck is never too appealing.

Nevertheless, MaRShall Plan allows the American’s to lock down their advantage in Europe. Stefan adds 1 to France (6C/0), W. Germany (5C/0), the UK (4/0), Spain (1/0), Greece (1/0), Turkey (1/0) and Benelux (1/0).

He takes a large stride forward and signals a potential European scoring by snagging Greece—not that Chris can do much about it at this stage.

Had he succeeded the whole tenor of this turn would have shifted. Now board position and victory points are beginning to align for the Soviets.\\\\n\\\\nAll the big, Early War events have come out and they have all come out for the Soviets. Stefan has withstood a pounding al- ready. At least he gets a little revenge by launching some “fellow travelers” from the Italian parliament into low earth orbit.

Duck and Cover, because of its DEFCON impact is a dangerous card to be holding when DEFCON is low. Besides the US has put a satellite up, can the Soviets just sit still for that?\\\\n\\\\nStefan is trying to make lemonade out of lemons.

A fair trade, and at least Red Scare can’t hurt a 1 Op.\\\\n\\\\nUS Action Round 4: Independent Reds (1 Op modified) as Influence point.

He uses his one operation point to crawl towards presence in Africa.\\\\n\\\\nUSSR Action Round 5: caPtuRed nazi ScientiStS (\\\\x18 Op) as Influence point.

Suez cRiSiS is used by the Soviet player (Stefan allows him to go first) to remove 2 influence from France (1/0) and 2 from the UK (3/0). Britain is in no immediate threat, so Stefan adds both influence back to France. European balance unchanged, and a threat to France is out of the deck.

Together with Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia, Voice of America became a hallmark of US public diplomacy efforts dur- ing the Cold War.\\\\n\\\\nLIBERATION THEOLOGY — (\\\\x18969 – ?) An outgrowth of the Second Vatican Council, liberation theology stresses Jesus Christ as liberator. The theological strain that sustained this outlook origi- nated in Latin America and flourished there, particularly with the Jesuit order. While never embraced by Pope John Paul II due to its Marxist undercurrents, liberation theology remains very popular with individual priests and the laity in the third world. Its emphasis on social justice and its critique of capitalist excess has, however, been incorporated into broader Church doctrine.' metadata={'source': 'local'}\"}], 'temperature': 1, 'n': 1, 'stream': False, 'max_tokens': 256, 'extra_body': {}}'\n",

Twilight Struggle, more than anything else, is a game designed to meet our needs. We are both huge fans of the card driven wargame, and how it has breathed new life into wargaming in general. Like a modern day Lazarus, card driven wargames have brought our hobby back from the grave. Yet even five years ago, when Ananda and I first decided we wanted to try our hand at design, the writing was on the wall. Card driven games were going to become less and less like We The People, and Hannibal, and more and more like Paths of Glory and Barbarossa to Berlin. That is not a critique of Mr. Raicer’s work. In fact, we think that it took Paths of Glory to demonstrate just how rich a card driven game might be. But it conflicted with another reality. We were getting older. Our lives were less like the gaming rich days of college, and more like the work-a-day world of the “nuclear” family. Eight hours for a single game was becoming less and less likely. So selfishly, we designed a game to fit our schedules. You can play Twilight Struggle from beginning to end in the same time it takes to play the “short” scenario of many other games. Heck, you can switch sides and play the Cold War from both angles if you are really ambitious. That is a long way of saying the number one constraint on the design was time.\\\\n\\\\nThe second question that we had to answer was the subject area. I believe that civil wars are the perfect subject for the influence system. So initially, I convinced Ananda to try a Spanish Civil War design. A couple of books on the subject quickly convinced us that it would takes years to master the politics of that war, and frankly, we weren’t going to wait years to start. So Ananda, in a stroke of genius, suggested the Cold War as a replacement. It was a great topic. There are very few games that deal with the politi- cal aspects of the Cold War in a serious way—there were not that many of them even when we were fighting the Cold War. The basic influence system translated well. The history was a non issue, for as an International Relations major in the \\\\x18980’s, I basically spent four years studying the Cold War. Finally, one of the best gam- ing experiences that I ever had was Chris Crawford’s Balance of Power.

Twilight Struggle, more than anything else, is a game designed to meet our needs. We are both huge fans of the card driven wargame, and how it has breathed new life into wargaming in general. Like a modern day Lazarus, card driven wargames have brought our hobby back from the grave. Yet even five years ago, when Ananda and I first decided we wanted to try our hand at design, the writing was on the wall. Card driven games were going to become less and less like We The People, and Hannibal, and more and more like Paths of Glory and Barbarossa to Berlin. That is not a critique of Mr. Raicer’s work. In fact, we think that it took Paths of Glory to demonstrate just how rich a card driven game might be. But it conflicted with another reality. We were getting older. Our lives were less like the gaming rich days of college, and more like the work-a-day world of the “nuclear” family. Eight hours for a single game was becoming less and less likely. So selfishly, we designed a game to fit our schedules. You can play Twilight Struggle from beginning to end in the same time it takes to play the “short” scenario of many other games. Heck, you can switch sides and play the Cold War from both angles if you are really ambitious. That is a long way of saying the number one constraint on the design was time.\\\\n\\\\nThe second question that we had to answer was the subject area. I believe that civil wars are the perfect subject for the influence system. So initially, I convinced Ananda to try a Spanish Civil War design. A couple of books on the subject quickly convinced us that it would takes years to master the politics of that war, and frankly, we weren’t going to wait years to start. So Ananda, in a stroke of genius, suggested the Cold War as a replacement. It was a great topic. There are very few games that deal with the politi- cal aspects of the Cold War in a serious way—there were not that many of them even when we were fighting the Cold War. The basic influence system translated well. The history was a non issue, for as an International Relations major in the \\\\x18980’s, I basically spent four years studying the Cold War. Finally, one of the best gam- ing experiences that I ever had was Chris Crawford’s Balance of Power. It was a game about Cold War politics, and even more so, about the brinksmanship of a crisis between the superpowers. To this day, computer gamers look back on its innovation. I’ll never forget the game’s immortal line when you brought the world to nuclear destruction over something ridiculous like funding gueril- las in Kenya.\\\\n\\\\nvery definite point of view.

Nixon dispatched Henry Kissinger to secret talks with the PRC’s foreign minister Chou En-lai to lay the groundwork for the visit. Capitalizing on deteriorating Sino-Soviet relations, Nixon scored perhaps the greatest diplomatic coup of the Cold War. The Shanghai Communique that followed the summit danced around several fundamental disagreements between the two countries, in- cluding Taiwan and Vietnam. However, it was clear that the Soviet Union could no longer depend upon Chinese support in regional conflicts. While Nixon expressed his desire to fully normalize re- lations between the two countries quickly, Watergate interrupted these plans. It would fall to Jimmy Carter to restore full diplomatic relations between the two countries.\\\\n\\\\nUSSURI RIVER SKIRMISH — (\\\\x18969) After years of deteriorat- ing relations and China’s first nuclear test, forces of the People’s Republic of China and the Soviet Union clashed along their long and porous border. The Ussuri and Amur Rivers’ possession remained uncertain between the two nations and were a source of friction. Following a military buildup on both sides of the border, tensions spilled over into a several sharp skirmishes. While full-blown war was avoided, the fighting led directly to the People’s Republic of China’s interest in rapidly normalizing relations with the United States.\\\\n\\\\n“ASK NOT WHAT YOUR COUNTRY CAN DO FOR YOU . . .” — (\\\\x1896\\\\x18) The seminal line of perhaps the most powerful inaugural address ever given by a US president, President Kennedy ushered in an era of American confidence and resolve during the Cold War. Popular with American youth, Kennedy inspired a renewed dedica-\\\\n\\\\n© 2007 GMT Games, LLC\\\\n\\\\n27\\\\n\\\\n28\\\\n\\\\nTwilight Struggle —2nd Edition—\\\\n\\\\ntion for public service both with ambitious goals for government sponsored science and youth oriented public service like the Peace Corps. His call for selfless dedication to the needs of the nation reflected the passion of a restless generation of young Americans eager to make their mark upon the world.\\\\n\\\\nALLIANCE FOR PROGRESS — (\\\\x1896\\\\x18 – \\\\x18973) Initiated by President Kennedy as a counter for growing Cuban influence in Central and South America, the Alliance for Progress was to help integrate the economies of North and Latin America. Emphases for the program included land reform, democratic reform and tax reform. By the late 60’s the United States had become fully embroiled in Vietnam and South Asia, thus aid for Latin America waned. Furthermore, few Latin American countries proved willing to undertake the required reforms. As a result, the Organization of American States disbanded its “permanent” Alliance for Progress Committee in \\\\x18973.\\\\n\\\\nAFRICA SCORING — African history throughout the Cold War reflects the promise and tragedy that go hand in hand with that continent’s experience. At first buoyed by the political success of rapid decolonization, the jubilation would devolve into cynicism. One after another, newly independent governments would give way to “presidents for life,” political corruption, economic chaos and ethnic violence. Lacking resources, African governments quickly took advantage of the superpower rivalry to maximize economic and military support for their regimes. In the post-colonial era, a variety of proxy civil wars were fought on the continent. Angola, Mozambique, Chad and Ethiopia were but a few of the nations that experienced violence theoretically in the name of the global struggle between communism and capitalism.' metadata={'source': 'local'}\"}], 'temperature': 1, 'n': 1, 'stream': False, 'max_tokens': 256, 'extra_body': {}}'\n",

At the other extreme, Rhodesia’s first majority elections spelled doom for the apartheid system.\\\\n\\\\nRED SCARE/PURGE — (\\\\x18945 – \\\\x18989) Sparked by fears that the “enemy is among us,” the “red scare” hit its apex with Senator Joseph McCarthy, and the hearings on “Un-American activities” in the House of Representatives during the \\\\x18950s. Soviet purges were a notorious aspect of power transition within the Kremlin. However, Stalin was the true master; \\\\x182 million people were imprisoned in his camps at the time of his death in \\\\x18953.\\\\n\\\\nUN INTERVENTION — (\\\\x18947 – ?) The United Nations remained generally unable to influence the struggle between the superpowers due to Security Council veto power throughout the Cold War. However, it occasionally stood as a gauge for world opinion, and could mediate in stalled conflicts throughout the Third World. It was also the backdrop for a number of quintessential moments of the conflict, including the Soviet Korean War walkout, the “We Will Bury You” speech, and of course, the Cuban Missile Crisis—don’t wait for the translation Mr. Zorin!\\\\n\\\\nDE-STALINIZATION — (\\\\x18956) During the 20th Party Congress, Nikita Khrushchev openly attacked Stalin’s leadership of the Soviet Union. It was seen both inside and outside the Soviet Union as the beginning of a new era. This proved to be a particularly bloody assumption for Nagy’s Hungary. Khrushchev had no intention of “liberalizing” Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, even if he was trying to bring an end to the cult of personality that had character- ized internal Soviet government.\\\\n\\\\nSOUTH AMERICAN SCORING — The regional penchant to turn to strong men or military juntas to resolve questions of instability made South America ripe for leftist reaction throughout the Cold War. Rising nationalism and the world-wide wave of anti-imperialist sentiment also characterized the relationship with the United States and the nations of South America.

Sparking the retreat from empire was Britain’s fulfilled promise of independence for India in 1947. At the other extreme, Rhodesia’s first majority elections spelled doom for the apartheid system.\\\\n\\\\nRED SCARE/PURGE — (\\\\x18945 – \\\\x18989) Sparked by fears that the “enemy is among us,” the “red scare” hit its apex with Senator Joseph McCarthy, and the hearings on “Un-American activities” in the House of Representatives during the \\\\x18950s. Soviet purges were a notorious aspect of power transition within the Kremlin. However, Stalin was the true master; \\\\x182 million people were imprisoned in his camps at the time of his death in \\\\x18953.\\\\n\\\\nUN INTERVENTION — (\\\\x18947 – ?) The United Nations remained generally unable to influence the struggle between the superpowers due to Security Council veto power throughout the Cold War. However, it occasionally stood as a gauge for world opinion, and could mediate in stalled conflicts throughout the Third World. It was also the backdrop for a number of quintessential moments of the conflict, including the Soviet Korean War walkout, the “We Will Bury You” speech, and of course, the Cuban Missile Crisis—don’t wait for the translation Mr. Zorin!\\\\n\\\\nDE-STALINIZATION — (\\\\x18956) During the 20th Party Congress, Nikita Khrushchev openly attacked Stalin’s leadership of the Soviet Union. It was seen both inside and outside the Soviet Union as the beginning of a new era. This proved to be a particularly bloody assumption for Nagy’s Hungary. Khrushchev had no intention of “liberalizing” Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, even if he was trying to bring an end to the cult of personality that had character- ized internal Soviet government.\\\\n\\\\nSOUTH AMERICAN SCORING — The regional penchant to turn to strong men or military juntas to resolve questions of instability made South America ripe for leftist reaction throughout the Cold War. Rising nationalism and the world-wide wave of anti-imperialist sentiment also characterized the relationship with the United States and the nations of South America. The Soviets sought to exploit any openings offered, and established close relations with nations like Argentina.

Nixon dispatched Henry Kissinger to secret talks with the PRC’s foreign minister Chou En-lai to lay the groundwork for the visit. Capitalizing on deteriorating Sino-Soviet relations, Nixon scored perhaps the greatest diplomatic coup of the Cold War. The Shanghai Communique that followed the summit danced around several fundamental disagreements between the two countries, in- cluding Taiwan and Vietnam. However, it was clear that the Soviet Union could no longer depend upon Chinese support in regional conflicts. While Nixon expressed his desire to fully normalize re- lations between the two countries quickly, Watergate interrupted these plans. It would fall to Jimmy Carter to restore full diplomatic relations between the two countries.\\\\n\\\\nUSSURI RIVER SKIRMISH — (\\\\x18969) After years of deteriorat- ing relations and China’s first nuclear test, forces of the People’s Republic of China and the Soviet Union clashed along their long and porous border. The Ussuri and Amur Rivers’ possession remained uncertain between the two nations and were a source of friction. Following a military buildup on both sides of the border, tensions spilled over into a several sharp skirmishes. While full-blown war was avoided, the fighting led directly to the People’s Republic of China’s interest in rapidly normalizing relations with the United States.\\\\n\\\\n“ASK NOT WHAT YOUR COUNTRY CAN DO FOR YOU . . .” — (\\\\x1896\\\\x18) The seminal line of perhaps the most powerful inaugural address ever given by a US president, President Kennedy ushered in an era of American confidence and resolve during the Cold War. Popular with American youth, Kennedy inspired a renewed dedica-\\\\n\\\\n© 2007 GMT Games, LLC\\\\n\\\\n27\\\\n\\\\n28\\\\n\\\\nTwilight Struggle —2nd Edition—\\\\n\\\\ntion for public service both with ambitious goals for government sponsored science and youth oriented public service like the Peace Corps. His call for selfless dedication to the needs of the nation reflected the passion of a restless generation of young Americans eager to make their mark upon the world.\\\\n\\\\nALLIANCE FOR PROGRESS — (\\\\x1896\\\\x18 – \\\\x18973) Initiated by President Kennedy as a counter for growing Cuban influence in Central and South America, the Alliance for Progress was to help integrate the economies of North and Latin America. Emphases for the program included land reform, democratic reform and tax reform. By the late 60’s the United States had become fully embroiled in Vietnam and South Asia, thus aid for Latin America waned. Furthermore, few Latin American countries proved willing to undertake the required reforms. As a result, the Organization of American States disbanded its “permanent” Alliance for Progress Committee in \\\\x18973.\\\\n\\\\nAFRICA SCORING — African history throughout the Cold War reflects the promise and tragedy that go hand in hand with that continent’s experience. At first buoyed by the political success of rapid decolonization, the jubilation would devolve into cynicism. One after another, newly independent governments would give way to “presidents for life,” political corruption, economic chaos and ethnic violence. Lacking resources, African governments quickly took advantage of the superpower rivalry to maximize economic and military support for their regimes. In the post-colonial era, a variety of proxy civil wars were fought on the continent. Angola, Mozambique, Chad and Ethiopia were but a few of the nations that experienced violence theoretically in the name of the global struggle between communism and capitalism.' metadata={'source': 'local'}\"}], 'temperature': 1, 'n': 1, 'stream': False, 'max_tokens': 256, 'extra_body': {}}'\n",

While a threat as old as human civilization, the use of terrorism as an instrument to change international policy ebbed and flowed throughout the Cold War. The Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies were known to train terrorist organizations within their borders, including radical elements of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). In many ways, the PLO provided the archetype for a terrorist organization throughout the Cold War. With its anti-Western, anti-Israel ideology, it became a cause celebre for those asserting that the West was on a neo-imperialist crusade in the third world. Palestinian terrorists hijacked planes, attacked the Achille Lauro, and perhaps most infamously murdered \\\\x18\\\\x18 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in \\\\x18972. There were also western based, communist affiliated terrorists such as the Red Brigades in Italy, and the Red Army in Japan.

While a threat as old as human civilization, the use of terrorism as an instrument to change international policy ebbed and flowed throughout the Cold War. The Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies were known to train terrorist organizations within their borders, including radical elements of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). In many ways, the PLO provided the archetype for a terrorist organization throughout the Cold War. With its anti-Western, anti-Israel ideology, it became a cause celebre for those asserting that the West was on a neo-imperialist crusade in the third world. Palestinian terrorists hijacked planes, attacked the Achille Lauro, and perhaps most infamously murdered \\\\x18\\\\x18 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in \\\\x18972. There were also western based, communist affiliated terrorists such as the Red Brigades in Italy, and the Red Army in Japan. As the Cold War came to a close, and the Soviet Union faced increasing difficulty with Muslim fun- damentalism, its support for terrorism waned.\\\\n\\\\nMARINE BARRACKS BOMBING — (\\\\x18983) After the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the United States and France dispatched troops to form a peace keeping force between the opposing sides. Terror- ist attacks on the troop barracks of both nations resulted in terrible losses. 24\\\\x18 US servicemen and 58 French paratroopers were killed in the attacks. It was the worst single day of casualties suffered by the US Marine Corps since Iwo Jima. While US suspicions have focused on Iranian sponsored Hezbollah terrorists, precise respon- sibility remains unknown.\\\\n\\\\nSOVIETS SHOOT DOWN KAL-007 — (\\\\x18983) Flying from New York City, to Seoul, South Korea, the doomed Korean Airlines Flight 007 strayed into Soviet Airspace due to a navigational error involving the plane’s autopilot system. While the Soviets contemporaneously claimed that they did not know that plane was civilian, tape releases after the Cold War indicate that little if any warning was given to the airliner. The Reagan administration rallied global reaction against the Soviets—even playing decoded messages before the UN Security Council. 269 passengers and crew were killed during the attack, including one member of Congress.\\\\n\\\\nGLASNOST — (\\\\x18985 – \\\\x18989) The Russian word for openness, Glasnost was introduced as a public policy by Mikhail Gorbachev.

Reagan, with the Brandenburg gate in the background, declared: “General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate!

At different times, during different crises, this policy was pursued by both superpowers. However, there was always the danger that brinksmanship could turn the “cold” war, hot. Additionally, brinksmanship encouraged a nuclear posture of “launch on warning.” Game theory demanded that if your op- ponent were launching a massive nuclear strike, you would have to launch your own weapons before they could be destroyed in their silos. These doctrines shortened reaction times of world leaders from hours to minutes. On November 9th, \\\\x18979, the United States made preparations for a retaliatory nuclear strike when a NORAD computer glitch indicated an all-out Soviet strike had been launched.

Initially, Iraq scored limited gains, but Iranian forces rallied and began a counter offensive into Iraq. Without set allies in the conflict, the United States played a cynical game of attempting to keep both sides sufficiently supplied for the war to continue. Ultimately, the US began to tilt to Iraq as an Iranian victory in the war would have been an unacceptable outcome. Iran also utilized oil as a weapon necessitating the US flagging of Kuwaiti tankers to ensure oil sup- plies. After 8 years of war, the border returned to its ante bellum status.

These negotiations had been suspended in \\\\x18983, and the successful deployment of the Pershing II’s provided impetus for restarting the talks in \\\\x18985.

Examples of this type of defector include KGB Deputy Chief Yuri Nosenko and KGB London Bureau Chief Oleg Gordievsky. Perhaps more embarassingly, and certainly more publicly, many talentend Soviet artists defected while on tour in the United States or Europe.

We want to evoke the feel of the Cold War, we hope people get a few insights they didn’t possess, but we have no pretensions that a game of this scope or length could pretend to be a simulation.\\\\n\\\\nAlso important for players to understand is that the game has a\\\\n\\\\nAt the end of the day, Twilight Struggle represents a bit of Cold War nostalgia. In a world of stateless enemies, for whom our destruction is an end in itself, the Cold War seems a quaint disagreement about economics. As religious chauvinism shoves aside ideology, we yearn for a simpler time absent of invisible menaces, fighting for cherished principle against an enemy that we understood. So let us once more pound our shoes, grab the hotline, and stand watch in Berlin. The Cold War is over, but the game has just begun.\\\\n\\\\n© 2007 GMT Games, LLC\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\x18\\\\n\\\\n32\\\\n\\\\nTwilight Struggle —2nd Edition—\\\\n\\\\nGMT Games, LLC • P.O.
