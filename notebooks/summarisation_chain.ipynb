We have faced three generational global economic challenges: the aftermath of the financial crisis; a global pandemic; and the biggest energy shock since the 1970s.\\\\n\\\\nAgainst this backdrop, since 2010 the UK has had the third highest growth rate in the G7. We have created four million more jobs, cut taxes for working people and pensioners and repaired the public finances. The UK economy is now growing faster than Germany, France, Italy and the United States, real wages have been rising for nearly a year, inflation has fallen from 11.1% to 2.3%, lower than in Europe and the US, and debt as a share of GDP is forecast to start falling next year. The plan we set out last year, to halve inflation, grow the economy and reduce debt, is working.\\\\n\\\\nEconomic security is the bedrock of any future success, which is why we have a clear plan to take the bold action needed to build a strong economy.\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nreducing borrowing and debt;\\\\n\\\\n❱ backing businesses to invest, innovate and\\\\n\\\\ntrade;\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\ncutting taxes and reforming our welfare system;\\\\n\\\\n❱ delivering world-class education; and\\\\n\\\\n❱ delivering an affordable transition to\\\\n\\\\ndomestic, sustainable energy.\\\\n\\\\nReducing debt and borrowing\\\\n\\\\nSustainable public finances are essential for a strong economic plan. It was only because of the difficult decisions we took to repair the public\\\\n\\\\n6\\\\n\\\\nfinances after 2010, which saw the deficit fall from 10.3% under Labour to 2.1% on the eve of the pandemic, that we were able to provide almost £400 billion of support to families and businesses to get through Covid and the energy shock.\\\\n\\\\nThe only way to give people the peace of mind that government will be able to support them again when future shocks hit is to get borrowing and debt down. The alternative is to let borrowing get out of control, driving inflation and interest rates up, and leaving our children and grandchildren to pick up the bill.\\\\n\\\\nIn the next Parliament, we will continue to meet our fiscal rules of having public sector net debt falling and for public sector net borrowing to be below 3% of GDP in the fifth year of the forecast. The measures in this manifesto are fully funded and would result in lower borrowing in 2029-30, which will be the target year for our fiscal rules in the first fiscal event of the new Parliament�\\\\n\\\\nBacking business to invest, innovate and trade\\\\n\\\\nA competitive tax system\\\\n\\\\nThe Conservative Party will always be the party of business. It is the private sector which will unlock the investment, growth and opportunities of the future.\\\\n\\\\nThat is why a tax system that incentivises business to invest is at the heart of our economic plan. We introduced the biggest business tax cut in modern British history, which hundreds of business leaders have described as the ‘single most transformational’ measure for growth and investment. So more businesses can benefit, we will look to extend our ‘full expensing’ policy to leasing, once the fiscal conditions allow. And we will not raise corporation tax. For the very smallest businesses, the four million people who are self-employed, we will abolish the main rate of National Insurance entirely by the end of the next Parliament. We will back the risk\\\\n\\\\ntakers and entrepreneurs who help drive our economy.\\\\n\\\\nProperty Relief and Business Relief. We will not increase Capital Gains Tax.\\\\n\\\\nSmall and medium-sized businesses are the lifeblood of our economy and we are making the UK the best place in the world to start or grow a business. We have great foundations: world-class talent, an internationally envied legal system and a business-friendly regulatory environment.\\\\n\\\\n6� Promote digital invoicing and improve enforcement of the Prompt Payment Code to support small businesses with the perennial challenge of cashflow, building on our creation of the Small Business Commissioner with powers to tackle unfavourable payment practices.\\\\n\\\\nWe are supporting firms with a business rates support package worth £4.3 billion over the next five years to support small businesses and the high street. We want small businesses to get a bigger share of public contracts and have improved the public sector procurement system to that end. We have made it easier and cheaper for small businesses to hire an apprentice. And we have taken 28,000 small businesses out of paying VAT altogether by raising the VAT registration threshold to £90,000. In the next Parliament, we will deliver a ten point plan to support SMEs:\\\\n\\\\n1� Continue to ease the burden of business rates for high street, leisure and hospitality businesses by increasing the multiplier on distribution warehouses that support online shopping over time.\\\\n\\\\n7� Ensure that Basel III capital requirements do not inhibit lending to SMEs�\\\\n\\\\n8� Continue our world leading programmes including the Invest in Women Task Force and the Lilac Review to encourage more female and disabled entrepreneurs.\\\\n\\\\n9� Work with the British Business Bank and private sector fund managers to secure a £250 million Invest In Women Fund to support female entrepreneurs.\\\\n\\\\n10� Work with public sector organisations including local authorities and NHS trusts and companies benefitting from government contracts to ensure that procurement opportunities are focused on SMEs in their local economies where possible and practical�\\\\n\\\\nInvesting in infrastructure\\\\n\\\\n2� Keep the VAT threshold under review and explore options to smooth the cliff edge at £90,000.\\\\n\\\\nA Conservative Government will continue to invest in the digital, transport and energy infrastructure needed for businesses to grow.\\\\n\\\\n3� Improve access to finance for SMEs including through expanding Open Finance and by exploring the creation of Regional Mutual Banks.\\\\n\\\\n4� Take more companies out of the scope of burdensome reporting requirements� Making use of freedoms granted by Brexit, we will lift the employee threshold allowing more companies to be considered medium-sized. This is expected to save small businesses at least one million hours of admin per year.\\\\n\\\\nWe have transformed our digital infrastructure by rolling out gigabit broadband to over a million hard to reach premises, helping to deliver high-speed internet to over 80% of the country. We are set to achieve at least 85% gigabit coverage of the UK by 2025 and nationwide coverage by 2030. Our ambition is for all populated areas to be covered by ‘standalone’ 5G mobile connectivity and to keep the UK at the forefront of adopting and developing 6G.\\\\n\\\\n5� Retain key tax incentives that encourage small businesses to grow, including the Enterprise Investment Scheme, Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme, Venture Capital Trusts, Business Asset Disposal Relief, Agricultural\\\\n\\\\nWe will spend £36 billion of HS2 savings on transport projects that will benefit more people, in more places, more quickly. Every penny saved in the North or Midlands will be spent there. Savings from our new plan for Euston,\\\\n\\\\n7\\\\n\\\\nwhich will see 10,000 new homes built, have freed up £6.5 billion for transport across the rest of the country.\\\\n\\\\nLabour has no plan. They neither support the second phase of HS2 nor our alternative package of investment, meaning they won’t back schemes their own local leaders say will transform their areas. We will:\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nInvest £4.7 billion for smaller cities, towns and rural areas in the North and Midlands to spend on their transport priorities. This will cut congestion and upgrade local bus and train stations.\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nInvest a record £8.3 billion of investment to fill potholes and resurface roads. We will bring forward funding into this financial year and the next.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Back our city regions with an additional\\\\n\\\\n£8.55 billion to spend on their local priorities. We will scrap rules that stop Mayors investing in strategic roads.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Deliver our plan for Northern Powerhouse Rail bringing more frequent trains, more capacity and faster journeys. We have committed £12 billion on top of our HS2 savings to deliver the section of Northern Powerhouse Rail between Manchester and Liverpool. Savings from HS2 enable us to fund electrification to Hull and build a new station in Bradford.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Boost rail connectivity in the Midlands,\\\\n\\\\nwith £1.75 billion to fund the Midlands Rail Hub in full. This will improve journey times and deliver more frequent rail services at 50 stations, benefiting over seven million people. We will upgrade the line between Newark and Nottingham to halve journey times between Nottingham and Leeds.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Provide an additional £1 billion to support hundreds of new bus routes across the North and Midlands.\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nImprove accessibility at 100 train stations,\\\\n\\\\n8\\\\n\\\\nstarting with the 50 stations announced in May.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Deliver upgrades to railways in the South\\\\n\\\\nWest, including the line through Dawlish, the Energy Coast Line in Cumbria and the Ely Junction scheme in East Anglia.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Electrify the North Wales Main Line with\\\\n\\\\n£1 billion of investment and alleviate pinch points on the A75 between Gretna and Stranraer.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Reopen Beeching lines and stations to\\\\n\\\\nreconnect communities around the country, building on the success of the Dartmoor Line in the South West. We are committed to all the schemes set out in the Network North Command Paper.\\\\n\\\\nThis comes on top of £44 billion of funding for Network Rail over the next five years and our investment in the Transpennine Route Upgrade, laying the foundations for Northern Powerhouse Rail. We will complete HS2 between London Euston and the West Midlands and support the growth of the rail freight sector.\\\\n\\\\nWe have invested £40 billion in England’s strategic roads between 2015 and 2025, with further investment to come in the next Road Investment Strategy, ensuring we can deliver major roads including the Lower Thames Crossing and the A303. This is alongside the road schemes set out in our Network North plan, including the A1 between Morpeth and Ellingham.' metadata={'source': 'local'}\"}], 'temperature': 1, 'n': 1, 'stream': False, 'max_tokens': 512, 'extra_body': {}}'\n",

We have faced three generational global economic challenges: the aftermath of the financial crisis; a global pandemic; and the biggest energy shock since the 1970s.\\\\n\\\\nAgainst this backdrop, since 2010 the UK has had the third highest growth rate in the G7. We have created four million more jobs, cut taxes for working people and pensioners and repaired the public finances. The UK economy is now growing faster than Germany, France, Italy and the United States, real wages have been rising for nearly a year, inflation has fallen from 11.1% to 2.3%, lower than in Europe and the US, and debt as a share of GDP is forecast to start falling next year. The plan we set out last year, to halve inflation, grow the economy and reduce debt, is working.\\\\n\\\\nEconomic security is the bedrock of any future success, which is why we have a clear plan to take the bold action needed to build a strong economy.\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nreducing borrowing and debt;\\\\n\\\\n❱ backing businesses to invest, innovate and\\\\n\\\\ntrade;\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\ncutting taxes and reforming our welfare system;\\\\n\\\\n❱ delivering world-class education; and\\\\n\\\\n❱ delivering an affordable transition to\\\\n\\\\ndomestic, sustainable energy.\\\\n\\\\nReducing debt and borrowing\\\\n\\\\nSustainable public finances are essential for a strong economic plan. It was only because of the difficult decisions we took to repair the public\\\\n\\\\n6\\\\n\\\\nfinances after 2010, which saw the deficit fall from 10.3% under Labour to 2.1% on the eve of the pandemic, that we were able to provide almost £400 billion of support to families and businesses to get through Covid and the energy shock.\\\\n\\\\nThe only way to give people the peace of mind that government will be able to support them again when future shocks hit is to get borrowing and debt down. The alternative is to let borrowing get out of control, driving inflation and interest rates up, and leaving our children and grandchildren to pick up the bill.\\\\n\\\\nIn the next Parliament, we will continue to meet our fiscal rules of having public sector net debt falling and for public sector net borrowing to be below 3% of GDP in the fifth year of the forecast. The measures in this manifesto are fully funded and would result in lower borrowing in 2029-30, which will be the target year for our fiscal rules in the first fiscal event of the new Parliament�\\\\n\\\\nBacking business to invest, innovate and trade\\\\n\\\\nA competitive tax system\\\\n\\\\nThe Conservative Party will always be the party of business. It is the private sector which will unlock the investment, growth and opportunities of the future.\\\\n\\\\nThat is why a tax system that incentivises business to invest is at the heart of our economic plan. We introduced the biggest business tax cut in modern British history, which hundreds of business leaders have described as the ‘single most transformational’ measure for growth and investment. So more businesses can benefit, we will look to extend our ‘full expensing’ policy to leasing, once the fiscal conditions allow. And we will not raise corporation tax. For the very smallest businesses, the four million people who are self-employed, we will abolish the main rate of National Insurance entirely by the end of the next Parliament. We will back the risk\\\\n\\\\ntakers and entrepreneurs who help drive our economy.\\\\n\\\\nProperty Relief and Business Relief. We will not increase Capital Gains Tax.\\\\n\\\\nSmall and medium-sized businesses are the lifeblood of our economy and we are making the UK the best place in the world to start or grow a business. We have great foundations: world-class talent, an internationally envied legal system and a business-friendly regulatory environment.\\\\n\\\\n6� Promote digital invoicing and improve enforcement of the Prompt Payment Code to support small businesses with the perennial challenge of cashflow, building on our creation of the Small Business Commissioner with powers to tackle unfavourable payment practices.\\\\n\\\\nWe are supporting firms with a business rates support package worth £4.3 billion over the next five years to support small businesses and the high street. We want small businesses to get a bigger share of public contracts and have improved the public sector procurement system to that end. We have made it easier and cheaper for small businesses to hire an apprentice. And we have taken 28,000 small businesses out of paying VAT altogether by raising the VAT registration threshold to £90,000. In the next Parliament, we will deliver a ten point plan to support SMEs:\\\\n\\\\n1� Continue to ease the burden of business rates for high street, leisure and hospitality businesses by increasing the multiplier on distribution warehouses that support online shopping over time.\\\\n\\\\n7� Ensure that Basel III capital requirements do not inhibit lending to SMEs�\\\\n\\\\n8� Continue our world leading programmes including the Invest in Women Task Force and the Lilac Review to encourage more female and disabled entrepreneurs.\\\\n\\\\n9� Work with the British Business Bank and private sector fund managers to secure a £250 million Invest In Women Fund to support female entrepreneurs.\\\\n\\\\n10� Work with public sector organisations including local authorities and NHS trusts and companies benefitting from government contracts to ensure that procurement opportunities are focused on SMEs in their local economies where possible and practical�\\\\n\\\\nInvesting in infrastructure\\\\n\\\\n2� Keep the VAT threshold under review and explore options to smooth the cliff edge at £90,000.\\\\n\\\\nA Conservative Government will continue to invest in the digital, transport and energy infrastructure needed for businesses to grow.\\\\n\\\\n3� Improve access to finance for SMEs including through expanding Open Finance and by exploring the creation of Regional Mutual Banks.\\\\n\\\\n4� Take more companies out of the scope of burdensome reporting requirements� Making use of freedoms granted by Brexit, we will lift the employee threshold allowing more companies to be considered medium-sized. This is expected to save small businesses at least one million hours of admin per year.\\\\n\\\\nWe have transformed our digital infrastructure by rolling out gigabit broadband to over a million hard to reach premises, helping to deliver high-speed internet to over 80% of the country. We are set to achieve at least 85% gigabit coverage of the UK by 2025 and nationwide coverage by 2030. Our ambition is for all populated areas to be covered by ‘standalone’ 5G mobile connectivity and to keep the UK at the forefront of adopting and developing 6G.\\\\n\\\\n5� Retain key tax incentives that encourage small businesses to grow, including the Enterprise Investment Scheme, Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme, Venture Capital Trusts, Business Asset Disposal Relief, Agricultural\\\\n\\\\nWe will spend £36 billion of HS2 savings on transport projects that will benefit more people, in more places, more quickly. Every penny saved in the North or Midlands will be spent there. Savings from our new plan for Euston,\\\\n\\\\n7\\\\n\\\\nwhich will see 10,000 new homes built, have freed up £6.5 billion for transport across the rest of the country.\\\\n\\\\nLabour has no plan. They neither support the second phase of HS2 nor our alternative package of investment, meaning they won’t back schemes their own local leaders say will transform their areas. We will:\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nInvest £4.7 billion for smaller cities, towns and rural areas in the North and Midlands to spend on their transport priorities. This will cut congestion and upgrade local bus and train stations.\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nInvest a record £8.3 billion of investment to fill potholes and resurface roads. We will bring forward funding into this financial year and the next.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Back our city regions with an additional\\\\n\\\\n£8.55 billion to spend on their local priorities. We will scrap rules that stop Mayors investing in strategic roads.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Deliver our plan for Northern Powerhouse Rail bringing more frequent trains, more capacity and faster journeys. We have committed £12 billion on top of our HS2 savings to deliver the section of Northern Powerhouse Rail between Manchester and Liverpool. Savings from HS2 enable us to fund electrification to Hull and build a new station in Bradford.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Boost rail connectivity in the Midlands,\\\\n\\\\nwith £1.75 billion to fund the Midlands Rail Hub in full. This will improve journey times and deliver more frequent rail services at 50 stations, benefiting over seven million people. We will upgrade the line between Newark and Nottingham to halve journey times between Nottingham and Leeds.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Provide an additional £1 billion to support hundreds of new bus routes across the North and Midlands.\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nImprove accessibility at 100 train stations,\\\\n\\\\n8\\\\n\\\\nstarting with the 50 stations announced in May.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Deliver upgrades to railways in the South\\\\n\\\\nWest, including the line through Dawlish, the Energy Coast Line in Cumbria and the Ely Junction scheme in East Anglia.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Electrify the North Wales Main Line with\\\\n\\\\n£1 billion of investment and alleviate pinch points on the A75 between Gretna and Stranraer.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Reopen Beeching lines and stations to\\\\n\\\\nreconnect communities around the country, building on the success of the Dartmoor Line in the South West. We are committed to all the schemes set out in the Network North Command Paper.\\\\n\\\\nThis comes on top of £44 billion of funding for Network Rail over the next five years and our investment in the Transpennine Route Upgrade, laying the foundations for Northern Powerhouse Rail. We will complete HS2 between London Euston and the West Midlands and support the growth of the rail freight sector.\\\\n\\\\nWe have invested £40 billion in England’s strategic roads between 2015 and 2025, with further investment to come in the next Road Investment Strategy, ensuring we can deliver major roads including the Lower Thames Crossing and the A303. This is alongside the road schemes set out in our Network North plan, including the A1 between Morpeth and Ellingham.' metadata={'source': 'local'}\"}], 'temperature': 1, 'n': 1, 'stream': False, 'max_tokens': 512, 'extra_body': {}}'\n",

But we can only ever cut taxes responsibly when we have a way to fund it sustainably, consistent with getting debt and borrowing down and in a way which does not send inflation spiralling.\\\\n\\\\nBecause of the support we provided to families and businesses through Covid and the energy shock, we had to make difficult decisions to pay down our debts. But we were clear that once inflation was under control and the public finances were on a sustainable path, we would cut taxes. Because of the progress we have made, with inflation back to normal and debt on track to fall from next year, we have been able to afford to begin cutting taxes as part of our plan to reward work and grow the economy, all without increasing borrowing or cutting spending on public services.\\\\n\\\\nCutting tax for working people\\\\n\\\\nIn the first half of this year, we began cutting National Insurance. It is unfair that working people pay two taxes on their income – income tax and National Insurance – when other people only pay income tax.\\\\n\\\\nOur long-term ambition, when it is affordable to do so, is to keep cutting National Insurance until it’s gone, as part of our plan to make the tax system simpler and fairer. As the next step in that plan, we will cut employee National Insurance to 6% by April 2027 – meaning that we will have halved it from 12% at the beginning of this year, a total tax cut of £1,350 for the average worker on £35,000. This comes on top of the significant above\\\\n\\\\n14\\\\n\\\\ninflation increase to the personal allowance we have delivered since 2010, nearly doubling it from £6,475 to £12,750.\\\\n\\\\nThis means the tax burden on workers is falling, with the average earner paying the lowest effective personal tax rate since 1975 – lower than in the US, France, Germany or any G7 country.\\\\n\\\\nAs a further downpayment on our long-term ambition to abolish National Insurance, there is one group for whom we will make that a reality in the next Parliament. Last year, the main rate of National Insurance for the self-employed stood at 9%. To recognise the unique contribution of these risk-takers and entrepreneurs to our economy and the insecurity they face without the rights and protections that employees enjoy, we will abolish it entirely by the end of the next Parliament. The abolition of the main rate of Class 4 National Insurance contributions builds on our abolition of Class 2 contributions for self-employed people from April this year. This will not affect their entitlement to the State Pension. This is a massive simplification of the tax system which means that 93% of self-employed people – four million of them – will no longer pay self- employed National Insurance.\\\\n\\\\nAs well as cutting National Insurance for 29 million people, we will also not raise the rate of income tax or VAT.\\\\n\\\\nIncreasing pay for working people\\\\n\\\\nWe introduced the National Living Wage in 2016 and this year achieved our ambition of raising it to two thirds of median earnings – increasing it to £11.44 per hour and extending it to cover all workers aged over 21. This ended low pay for those on the National Living Wage, with someone working full-time receiving a pay rise worth £1,800. As a result of our personal tax cuts and increases in the minimum wage, the take-home pay of someone working full\\\\n\\\\ntime on the National Living Wage has gone up by 35% in real terms since 2010.\\\\n\\\\nWe will maintain the National Living Wage in each year of the next Parliament at two-thirds of median earnings. On current forecasts, that would mean it rising to around £13 per hour, up from a minimum wage of £5.80 under Labour in 2010.\\\\n\\\\nWe will ensure the UK retains the flexible and dynamic labour market that gives businesses the confidence to create jobs and invest in their workforce. The number of payrolled employees is at a near record high, and there are around four million more people in work than when we came to office in 2010.\\\\n\\\\nCutting tax for pensioners\\\\n\\\\n2. Ensuring that from next year the tax-\\\\n\\\\nfree personal allowance for pensioners also rises by the highest of prices, earnings or 2.5%, guaranteeing that the new State Pension is always below the tax-free threshold. From April 2025, we will increase the personal allowance for pensioners by introducing a new age-related personal allowance. This is a tax cut of around £100 for eight million pensioners next year – rising to £275 a year by the end of the Parliament.\\\\n\\\\nUnder our new Pensions Tax Guarantee, the Conservatives will not introduce any new taxes on pensions. We will maintain the 25% tax free lump sum and maintain tax relief on pension contributions at their marginal rate. We will not extend National Insurance to employer pension contributions.\\\\n\\\\nWe believe that those who have worked hard during their lives should have dignity and security in their retirement. We came to power in 2010 after Labour had hit pensioners with a £118 billion pensions tax raid and a paltry 75p per week increase to the State Pension.\\\\n\\\\nSince 2010, we have made it a priority to give people peace of mind in their retirement. We introduced the Triple Lock, which has seen the basic State Pension rise by £3,700 since 2010. This year, the new State Pension increased by £900.\\\\n\\\\nWe will continue to do everything we can to provide pensioners with dignity in retirement and ensure the new State Pension is not dragged into income tax for the first time in history by introducing the new Triple Lock Plus. This has two elements:\\\\n\\\\nWe will maintain all current pensioner benefits, including free bus passes, Winter Fuel Payments, free prescriptions and TV licences. We are carefully considering the Ombudsman report into WASPI women and will work with Parliament to provide an appropriate and swift response.\\\\n\\\\nBy opposing the Triple Lock Plus, Labour’s Retirement Tax will mean millions of pensioners paying more tax. It will also mean that for the first time in history, someone whose only income is the new State Pension will be dragged into paying income tax, which alongside making them worse off means the administrative burden of going through a tax assessment.\\\\n\\\\n1. Continuing to uprate the State Pension in line with the highest of prices, earnings or 2.5%. On current forecasts, this will mean the new State Pension increases by a further £430 in April next year to £11,970; and increases by £1,685 a year to £13,200 by the end of the Parliament.\\\\n\\\\nClamping down on tax avoidance\\\\n\\\\nIt is vital we make sure people and companies are paying the tax they owe. That’s why, since 2010, Conservative Governments have introduced over 200 measures to tackle tax non-compliance. In total across all the fiscal events we have delivered since 2010, the OBR\\\\n\\\\n15\\\\n\\\\nhas scored these measures as raising £95 billion across the forecasts it has produced – £6.7 billion for each year. Building on that, we will raise at least a further £6 billion a year from tackling tax avoidance and evasion by the end of the Parliament.\\\\n\\\\n16\\\\n\\\\nThe Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2024\\\\n\\\\nOur plan to support families\\\\n\\\\n17\\\\n\\\\nThe Conservatives have a plan to deliver a brighter future for the UK, one where families are supported and children are given the best chance to gain the skills they need to succeed. We are delivering the largest ever expansion of childcare in history: ❱ Working parents of two-year-olds are now able to access 15 hours of free childcare, with over 200,000 two-year-olds already benefitting from the offer.\\\\n\\\\n❱ From September 2024, eligible parents\\\\n\\\\nof children between nine months and two years old will also be able to access 15 hours free childcare.\\\\n\\\\n❱ From September 2025, all eligible parents with children from nine months old to when they start school will be able to access 30 hours of free childcare a week.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Once the roll out is completed, families will\\\\n\\\\nsave an average of £6,900 per year.\\\\n\\\\nTo help the childcare sector expand we have committed to increasing hourly funding rates over the next two years by an estimated £500 million and are helping the sector, including childminders, to hire more staff, create more places and spend less time on paperwork. And to give working parents more flexibility, we are investing £300 million so that all parents can access wraparound childcare before and after school by September 2026.\\\\n\\\\nBut families’ needs don’t stop when children start primary school, which is why Family Hubs support families all the way up until children reach adulthood. They back families in the early years, helping with things like breastfeeding support, antenatal care and early learning interventions, in addition to services like relationship support, stopping smoking services and youth services.

We cannot allow a small and vocal minority to destroy our democratic values. That is why we unveiled a new extremism definition under which certain groups that promote an ideology based on violence, hatred or intolerance will be blocked from government funding and meeting officials.\\\\n\\\\nWe have passed tough new laws to curb disruptive protests. Our Public Order Act 2023 gave the police new powers to intervene where protests cause serious disruption to communities, leading to the arrests of over\\\\n\\\\n46\\\\n\\\\n600 Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion protestors in London alone. We will introduce further powers to ban face coverings, pyrotechnics and climbing on war memorials.\\\\n\\\\nWe will strengthen police powers to prevent protests or marches that pose a risk of serious disorder, by allowing police to take into account the cumulative impact of protests. We will ban protests outside schools to stop mobs from intimidating teachers and children. We will always support teachers to uphold and promote fundamental British values and ensure they are protected from accusations of blasphemy.\\\\n\\\\nWe will place a duty on the police and prosecutors to publish regular guidance on the statements, chants or symbols, for example, the swastika or the term ‘jihad’, that in the context of political protest may constitute an offence. We will explore ways for the police to recover some of the costs of policing disruptive protests from the groups that organise them.\\\\n\\\\nWe will also ensure our elected representatives get the protection needed to represent their constituents without fear.\\\\n\\\\nAbuse or discrimination based on religion is unacceptable. We will not tolerate antisemitic hatred in any form. We have pledged £54 million for the Community Security Trust to give Jewish schools and synagogues the security measures they need and allocated additional funding to support schools and universities to understand, recognise and tackle antisemitism. We will get the UK Holocaust Memorial built.\\\\n\\\\nWe do not tolerate anti-Muslim hatred and will seek to stamp it out wherever it occurs. We have committed to provide £117 million over four years for the Protective Security for Mosques scheme and are proud to support and help fund Tell MAMA’s vital work.\\\\n\\\\nThe Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2024\\\\n\\\\nOur plan for an affordable and pragmatic transition to net zero\\\\n\\\\n47\\\\n\\\\nIn the last few years, we have faced the greatest shock to our energy security since the 1970s. Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices spiralling. Because of the decisions we had taken to boost domestic energy production and invest in renewables, Britain had little reliance on Russian fuel when the invasion began, unlike some of our European neighbours. But when global energy prices spiked, the Government stepped in to pay around half the typical household bill at the peak, saving families £1,500 on average. Bills are now coming down, and in July will fall to the lowest level in over two years. But the shock has reminded us of the importance of securing our long-term energy supply.\\\\n\\\\nWe are proud of our record and remain committed to delivering net zero by 2050. Today the UK is home to the five largest offshore wind farms in the world. Half of our electricity comes from renewables, compared to just 7% when Labour were last in office. We have reduced emissions further and faster than any of our competitors and the UK is the first major economy to get halfway to net zero. And we have done this while growing our economy by 80%, demonstrating to other countries that there is a positive economic path to tackling climate change.\\\\n\\\\nDelivering energy security\\\\n\\\\nWe will boost our energy independence in an increasingly unstable world. We will legislate to ensure annual licensing rounds for oil and gas production from our own North Sea\\\\n\\\\n48\\\\n\\\\nto provide energy to homes and businesses across the country and protect high-skilled and well-paid jobs in the industry.\\\\n\\\\nLabour are committed to shutting down the North Sea, rejecting any new licenses. That would put 200,000 jobs and billions of pounds of tax receipts at risk. It would leave the UK more dependent on foreign powers and mean higher emissions from imported liquefied gas.\\\\n\\\\nWe introduced a windfall tax on oil and gas companies in 2022 to ensure they pay their fair share of tax from extraordinary profits while prices remain abnormally high. We will keep this in place until 2028-29, unless prices fall back to normal sooner. In total, this is expected to raise over £26 billion. We will maintain the investment allowances that provide incentives to invest in our North Sea, which Labour have said they would remove.\\\\n\\\\nWe will back up renewables and prevent the prospect of blackouts with new gas power stations to maintain a safe and reliable energy source for days when the weather doesn’t power up renewables. Conservatives know that if we are forced to choose between clean energy and keeping citizens safe and warm, we will choose to keep the lights on.\\\\n\\\\nWe are delivering record investment into UK renewables. But we need to go further, unlocking more investment to secure our energy supply in the future. In the next Parliament we will:\\\\n\\\\n❱ Treble our offshore wind capacity, to deliver low-cost, home-grown energy and support the development of vibrant industrial clusters in places like the North East of England, Scotland and Wales.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Build the first two carbon capture and storage clusters, based across North Wales and, the North West of England and Teesside and the Humber, cutting carbon and creating tens of thousands of jobs in these regions, and progress the second tranche of projects in Aberdeenshire and the Humber.\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nInvest £1.1 billion into the Green Industries Growth Accelerator to support British manufacturing capabilities, boost supply chains and ensure our energy transition is made in Britain.\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nScale up nuclear power, building on our work establishing Great British Nuclear. Within the first 100 days of the next Parliament, we will approve two new fleets of Small Modular Reactors to rapidly expand nuclear power, create well-paid, high-skilled jobs and deliver cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy. We will halve the time it takes for new nuclear reactors to be approved, by allowing regulators to assess projects while designs are being finalised, improving join-up with overseas regulators assessing the same technology and speeding up planning and environmental approvals.\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nDeliver a new gigawatt power plant at Wylfa in North Wales and work with industry to deliver existing projects at Hinkley Point and Sizewell.\\\\n\\\\nThis will help the UK to become a net exporter of electricity. And by building more electricity links with neighbouring countries, we can increase exports, make our energy system more efficient and bring additional revenue to the UK. We will ensure offshore cables help reduce the amount of onshore infrastructure, such as substations, that we need to build.\\\\n\\\\nAs we achieve this transition to net zero, we will take steps to ensure the technology and infrastructure is made here in the UK. We will provide a bonus, on top of contract payments that support offshore wind, to reward energy firms that invest in manufacturing in the most disadvantaged places in the UK or invest in more sustainable supply chains, creating more good jobs as we get more energy from renewables.\\\\n\\\\nsubsidised by foreign governments and helped public projects procure more UK-made steel. We agreed a £500 million grant as part of a £1.25 billion commitment by Tata Steel to transform and secure a sustainable future at their Port Talbot works. We will continue working to support production in Scunthorpe and the North East of England, securing the future of steelmaking across the UK.\\\\n\\\\nWe will implement a new import carbon pricing mechanism by 2027 to ensure that imports of iron, steel, aluminium, ceramics and cement from countries with a lower or no carbon price will face a comparable carbon price to those goods produced in the UK. This will reduce the risk of industry being displaced to other countries which aren’t taking action on climate change.\\\\n\\\\nA pragmatic and proportionate approach to net zero\\\\n\\\\nThe UK has led the world on tackling climate change, having cut our emissions more than any other major economy. We will get to net zero on the fairest possible path and in a way that brings people with us.\\\\n\\\\nWe will seize the opportunities created by the transition, opening up whole new sectors and creating hundreds of thousands of good jobs in all corners of the country. Our approach leverages the innovation and investment of the private sector to unleash technologies that cut costs for households. This has enabled us to overachieve on our targets, become a powerhouse in clean technologies, and continue to support households. We reject Labour’s dogmatic, top-down approach that will burden households with higher bills.\\\\n\\\\nWe will cut the cost of tackling climate change for households and business, and deliver net zero by 2050, by:\\\\n\\\\nWe are strong supporters of domestic steel production and have introduced effective safeguards against steel that is heavily\\\\n\\\\n❱ Sticking to our pragmatic, proportionate and realistic approach that eases the burdens on working people.

We will always support teachers to uphold and promote fundamental British values and ensure they are protected from accusations of blasphemy.\\\\n\\\\nWe will place a duty on the police and prosecutors to publish regular guidance on the statements, chants or symbols, for example, the swastika or the term ‘jihad’, that in the context of political protest may constitute an offence. We will explore ways for the police to recover some of the costs of policing disruptive protests from the groups that organise them.\\\\n\\\\nWe will also ensure our elected representatives get the protection needed to represent their constituents without fear.\\\\n\\\\nAbuse or discrimination based on religion is unacceptable. We will not tolerate antisemitic hatred in any form. We have pledged £54 million for the Community Security Trust to give Jewish schools and synagogues the security measures they need and allocated additional funding to support schools and universities to understand, recognise and tackle antisemitism. We will get the UK Holocaust Memorial built.\\\\n\\\\nWe do not tolerate anti-Muslim hatred and will seek to stamp it out wherever it occurs. We have committed to provide £117 million over four years for the Protective Security for Mosques scheme and are proud to support and help fund Tell MAMA’s vital work.\\\\n\\\\nThe Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2024\\\\n\\\\nOur plan for an affordable and pragmatic transition to net zero\\\\n\\\\n47\\\\n\\\\nIn the last few years, we have faced the greatest shock to our energy security since the 1970s. Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices spiralling. Because of the decisions we had taken to boost domestic energy production and invest in renewables, Britain had little reliance on Russian fuel when the invasion began, unlike some of our European neighbours. But when global energy prices spiked, the Government stepped in to pay around half the typical household bill at the peak, saving families £1,500 on average. Bills are now coming down, and in July will fall to the lowest level in over two years. But the shock has reminded us of the importance of securing our long-term energy supply.\\\\n\\\\nWe are proud of our record and remain committed to delivering net zero by 2050. Today the UK is home to the five largest offshore wind farms in the world. Half of our electricity comes from renewables, compared to just 7% when Labour were last in office. We have reduced emissions further and faster than any of our competitors and the UK is the first major economy to get halfway to net zero. And we have done this while growing our economy by 80%, demonstrating to other countries that there is a positive economic path to tackling climate change.\\\\n\\\\nDelivering energy security\\\\n\\\\nWe will boost our energy independence in an increasingly unstable world. We will legislate to ensure annual licensing rounds for oil and gas production from our own North Sea\\\\n\\\\n48\\\\n\\\\nto provide energy to homes and businesses across the country and protect high-skilled and well-paid jobs in the industry.\\\\n\\\\nLabour are committed to shutting down the North Sea, rejecting any new licenses. That would put 200,000 jobs and billions of pounds of tax receipts at risk. It would leave the UK more dependent on foreign powers and mean higher emissions from imported liquefied gas.\\\\n\\\\nWe introduced a windfall tax on oil and gas companies in 2022 to ensure they pay their fair share of tax from extraordinary profits while prices remain abnormally high. We will keep this in place until 2028-29, unless prices fall back to normal sooner. In total, this is expected to raise over £26 billion. We will maintain the investment allowances that provide incentives to invest in our North Sea, which Labour have said they would remove.\\\\n\\\\nWe will back up renewables and prevent the prospect of blackouts with new gas power stations to maintain a safe and reliable energy source for days when the weather doesn’t power up renewables. Conservatives know that if we are forced to choose between clean energy and keeping citizens safe and warm, we will choose to keep the lights on.\\\\n\\\\nWe are delivering record investment into UK renewables. But we need to go further, unlocking more investment to secure our energy supply in the future. In the next Parliament we will:\\\\n\\\\n❱ Treble our offshore wind capacity, to deliver low-cost, home-grown energy and support the development of vibrant industrial clusters in places like the North East of England, Scotland and Wales.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Build the first two carbon capture and storage clusters, based across North Wales and, the North West of England and Teesside and the Humber, cutting carbon and creating tens of thousands of jobs in these regions, and progress the second tranche of projects in Aberdeenshire and the Humber.\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nInvest £1.1 billion into the Green Industries Growth Accelerator to support British manufacturing capabilities, boost supply chains and ensure our energy transition is made in Britain.\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nScale up nuclear power, building on our work establishing Great British Nuclear. Within the first 100 days of the next Parliament, we will approve two new fleets of Small Modular Reactors to rapidly expand nuclear power, create well-paid, high-skilled jobs and deliver cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy. We will halve the time it takes for new nuclear reactors to be approved, by allowing regulators to assess projects while designs are being finalised, improving join-up with overseas regulators assessing the same technology and speeding up planning and environmental approvals.\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nDeliver a new gigawatt power plant at Wylfa in North Wales and work with industry to deliver existing projects at Hinkley Point and Sizewell.\\\\n\\\\nThis will help the UK to become a net exporter of electricity. And by building more electricity links with neighbouring countries, we can increase exports, make our energy system more efficient and bring additional revenue to the UK. We will ensure offshore cables help reduce the amount of onshore infrastructure, such as substations, that we need to build.\\\\n\\\\nAs we achieve this transition to net zero, we will take steps to ensure the technology and infrastructure is made here in the UK. We will provide a bonus, on top of contract payments that support offshore wind, to reward energy firms that invest in manufacturing in the most disadvantaged places in the UK or invest in more sustainable supply chains, creating more good jobs as we get more energy from renewables.\\\\n\\\\nsubsidised by foreign governments and helped public projects procure more UK-made steel. We agreed a £500 million grant as part of a £1.25 billion commitment by Tata Steel to transform and secure a sustainable future at their Port Talbot works. We will continue working to support production in Scunthorpe and the North East of England, securing the future of steelmaking across the UK.\\\\n\\\\nWe will implement a new import carbon pricing mechanism by 2027 to ensure that imports of iron, steel, aluminium, ceramics and cement from countries with a lower or no carbon price will face a comparable carbon price to those goods produced in the UK. This will reduce the risk of industry being displaced to other countries which aren’t taking action on climate change.\\\\n\\\\nA pragmatic and proportionate approach to net zero\\\\n\\\\nThe UK has led the world on tackling climate change, having cut our emissions more than any other major economy. We will get to net zero on the fairest possible path and in a way that brings people with us.\\\\n\\\\nWe will seize the opportunities created by the transition, opening up whole new sectors and creating hundreds of thousands of good jobs in all corners of the country. Our approach leverages the innovation and investment of the private sector to unleash technologies that cut costs for households. This has enabled us to overachieve on our targets, become a powerhouse in clean technologies, and continue to support households. We reject Labour’s dogmatic, top-down approach that will burden households with higher bills.\\\\n\\\\nWe will cut the cost of tackling climate change for households and business, and deliver net zero by 2050, by:\\\\n\\\\nWe are strong supporters of domestic steel production and have introduced effective safeguards against steel that is heavily\\\\n\\\\n❱ Sticking to our pragmatic, proportionate and realistic approach that eases the burdens on working people.

We will prioritise development of the Pencoed level crossing and progressing work on the South Wales Main Line, to deliver new stations and services.\\\\n\\\\nWe will expand our Backing Drivers’ Bill to cover Wales, reversing Labour’s blanket 20mph speed limit by requiring local consent for 20mph zones and giving local communities the legal right to challenge existing zones.\\\\n\\\\nTo support Wales’ key sectors and industrial heritage, Welsh farmers will benefit from a £1 billion increase to the UK-wide farming budget, ensuring the ringfenced amount directed to Welsh farmers increases by inflation throughout the next Parliament, as well as grants for innovative agricultural projects from the £20 million UK Farming Innovation Fund and the extension of the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Scheme.\\\\n\\\\nWe will also build on our new UK-wide food security index by putting a UK-wide food security target into law, adopt a consistent approach to biosecurity across Great Britain and require the Welsh Government to provide annual reports on how ringfenced agricultural funding from the UK Government is spent.\\\\n\\\\nWe will continue working with the Welsh Government on the expansion of Levelling Up Partnerships to Wales and support the Welsh language, including by backing Welsh broadcasting and the equitable provision of UK Government services in Welsh.\\\\n\\\\nWe will bring forward legislation to reapply the entirety of the Trade Union Act 2016 to Wales. And a Welsh Conservative Government would reverse Labour’s plans to expand the Senedd, redirecting the cost towards people’s real priorities.\\\\n\\\\nThe £500 million we are investing to secure a sustainable future for steelmaking in Port Talbot is bolstered by the £80 million the UK Government is providing to support the area to transition. We remain committed to delivering the electric arc furnace and supporting Port Talbot to thrive, including through the new Celtic Freeport. Floating offshore wind is at the heart of these plans and we will continue to support its development in the Celtic Sea. We will deliver the UK’s third mega-nuclear power station at Wylfa and support Wales’ potential to host small modular reactors.\\\\n\\\\nTo strengthen Wales’ public services, we will put an additional neighbourhood police officer in every community across Wales, restore trust in policing and introduce tougher sentencing to make Wales safer.\\\\n\\\\nImproving the comparability of data across the UK will ensure the current Labour Welsh Government are held to account for their performance running Wales’ schools and hospitals. We will assess options to promote choice in NHS services across the UK, whether provided by the NHS or independent sector, and improve interoperability between the NHS in different parts of the UK, cross-border healthcare processes and joint working to tackle waiting lists.\\\\n\\\\n75\\\\n\\\\nNorthern Ireland\\\\n\\\\nAs Conservatives and Unionists, we continue to hugely value Northern Ireland’s contribution to our Union. For us, the best future for Northern Ireland will always be as part of a strong, prosperous and dynamic United Kingdom. We will never be neutral in expressing our support for it.\\\\n\\\\nAt the same time, we respect those who seek a different constitutional outcome pursued by exclusively peaceful and democratic means. We will always govern in the interests of the whole community in Northern Ireland. Our aim is to build a Northern Ireland where politics works, the economy grows and society is stronger and more united.\\\\n\\\\nOur commitment to the 1998 Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in all its parts remains unwavering. Fundamental to the Agreement is the consent principle – that there can be no change to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland without the support of a majority of those who live there. Conservatives will always uphold the democratic wishes of the people of Northern Ireland.\\\\n\\\\n❱ We are committed to supporting Northern Ireland’s communities and economy to thrive. At the last Spending Review, we provided the Northern Ireland Executive with a record £15 billion a year through the block grant. To underpin the restoration of devolution, we provided the incoming Executive with a £3.3 billion spending package and subsequently agreed an interim fiscal framework in May 2024. We are also delivering over £1 billion of levelling up funding, including £150 million to develop an Enhanced Investment Zone. We hosted an Investment Summit in Northern Ireland last year, showcasing its innovation and technological strengths. And cutting National Insurance again will benefit 800,000 working people in Northern Ireland.\\\\n\\\\n❱ The Windsor Framework and our\\\\n\\\\nSafeguarding the Union Command Paper have addressed the fundamental problems with the old Northern Ireland Protocol\\\\n\\\\n76\\\\n\\\\nand provide Northern Ireland with unique advantages, including guaranteed unfettered access to the UK internal market and privileged access to the EU Single Market for goods. Through our UK internal market system, we have ensured that goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland that will only ever stay in the United Kingdom are subject to no checks, save for those conducted by UK authorities as part of a risk-based or intelligence-led approach to tackle criminality, abuse of the scheme, smuggling and disease risks. In addition, through the Stormont Brake we have addressed the democratic deficit in the old Protocol. A Conservative Government will faithfully implement all its commitments in the Windsor Framework and the Command Paper, including those measures to strengthen Northern Ireland’s place in the Union.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Through the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023 we have established the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery with £250 million of funding to ensure victims and survivors can recover more information about what happened to their loved ones than has been available through established mechanisms. We will continue to implement this legacy legislation and support the Commission with the aim of providing more answers to those that want them and helping society to move forward.\\\\n\\\\n❱ While the security situation has been\\\\n\\\\ntransformed for most people in Northern Ireland over the past three decades, there remains a very real threat from dissident republicans who retain both a capability and intent to cause harm. We will always give our fullest possible support to the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other agencies for the vital work they do to keep people safe and secure.

It is unfair for people to jump the queue in front of people who play by the rules. It is unfair for taxpayers to pay for the hotels and public services. And it is unfair for illegal migrants themselves who risk their lives in the hands of people smugglers.\\\\n\\\\nThe Conservatives are the only party with a plan to stop the boats and reduce the strain that illegal migration places on our communities and public services. Labour have no plan and would grant an amnesty to thousands of illegal migrants.\\\\n\\\\nWe have made progress. Last year, small boat arrivals to the UK fell by a third. Our work with international partners prevented more than 26,000 crossings last year. Our Albania deal shows that deterrence works, with numbers down 90%.\\\\n\\\\nBut the only way to stop the boats entirely is to remove the incentive to come – by making clear that if you come here illegally, you will not be allowed to stay. Only then will the boats stop coming and people stop dying in the Channel. We will:\\\\n\\\\n❱ Establish a deterrent. We will run a relentless, continual process of permanently removing illegal migrants to Rwanda with a regular rhythm of flights every month, starting this July, until the boats are stopped. If we are forced to choose between our security and the jurisdiction of a foreign court, including the ECtHR, we will always choose our security.\\\\n\\\\n❱ End the legal merry-go-round. We will stop illegal migrants from bringing spurious challenges to block their removal by bringing our Illegal Migration Act into force and clearing the asylum backlog, with all claims processed in six months and the use of hotels ended.\\\\n\\\\n36\\\\n\\\\n❱ Crack down on organised immigration crime, including through the National Crime Agency and our intelligence services, to disrupt supply chains and tackle people smugglers.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Reform asylum rules, holding an\\\\n\\\\ninternational summit and working with other countries to reform international laws to make them fit for an age of mass migration. We will restrict visa access from countries that don’t work with us on our national priorities, like illegal migration.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Return people with no right to be here\\\\n\\\\nto their own country. We will sign further returns deals like the one we have already agreed with Albania.\\\\n\\\\n❱ With control of our borders, we can do\\\\n\\\\nmore to help refugees fleeing persecution. In addition to maintaining visa schemes for people fleeing Hong Kong, Ukraine and our Afghan settlement schemes, we will give parliament control of how many places we offer on safe and legal routes to support those in genuine need from around the world, with a cap based on the capacity of local areas.\\\\n\\\\nDelivering sustainable levels of high-skilled migration\\\\n\\\\nImmigration is too high. We want to attract the brightest and best skilled migrants to the UK to contribute to our businesses and public services. We must bring migration numbers down to sustainable levels to reduce the impacts on public services and housing and to restore public confidence in the system.\\\\n\\\\nWe have already implemented changes which mean that 300,000 people who were eligible to come the UK last year now couldn’t. We have:\\\\n\\\\n❱ Ended the ability of almost all\\\\n\\\\ninternational students and all care workers to bring dependants.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Scrapped cut-price shortage labour\\\\n\\\\nfrom overseas, by abolishing the 20% going rate salary discount for shortage occupations.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Stopped immigration from undercutting British workers, by increasing the salary threshold for Skilled Worker visas by 48% to £38,700.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Ensured those sponsoring dependants can support them financially, by raising the minimum income for family visas to £38,700.\\\\n\\\\nGoing forward, we will raise the Skilled Worker threshold and Family income requirement with inflation automatically to make sure they don’t undercut UK workers.\\\\n\\\\nWe have taken steps to ensure those coming to the UK do not place a burden on the NHS, by requiring them to pay the Immigration Health Surcharge and increasing this to £1,035. We will go further, in line with other countries, by requiring migrants to undergo a health check in advance of travel and increasing their Immigration Health Surcharge or requiring them to buy health insurance if they are likely to be a burden on the NHS.\\\\n\\\\nWe will increase all visa fees and remove the student discount to the Immigration Health Surcharge to raise more money for public services.\\\\n\\\\nWe will continue to attract the brightest and best students to study in our world class institutions. We will ensure those who come here are able to integrate into communities and participate in the economy. We want to make sure our immigration system is fair and will continue delivering the Windrush Compensation Scheme. We are committed to the EU Settled Status Scheme and the rights it has guaranteed for EU citizens.\\\\n\\\\nOur plan to cut migration We need to control numbers and give the public confidence they will come down significantly.\\\\n\\\\n❱ We will introduce a binding, legal cap on migration, set on work and family visas so public services are protected whilst we bring the skills our businesses and the NHS needs.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Our cap will be set at a level that explicitly takes into account the costs and the benefits of migration.' metadata={'source': 'local'}\"}], 'temperature': 1, 'n': 1, 'stream': False, 'max_tokens': 512, 'extra_body': {}}'\n",

In addition to maintaining visa schemes for people fleeing Hong Kong, Ukraine and our Afghan settlement schemes, we will give parliament control of how many places we offer on safe and legal routes to support those in genuine need from around the world, with a cap based on the capacity of local areas.\\\\n\\\\nDelivering sustainable levels of high-skilled migration\\\\n\\\\nImmigration is too high. We want to attract the brightest and best skilled migrants to the UK to contribute to our businesses and public services. We must bring migration numbers down to sustainable levels to reduce the impacts on public services and housing and to restore public confidence in the system.\\\\n\\\\nWe have already implemented changes which mean that 300,000 people who were eligible to come the UK last year now couldn’t. We have:\\\\n\\\\n❱ Ended the ability of almost all\\\\n\\\\ninternational students and all care workers to bring dependants.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Scrapped cut-price shortage labour\\\\n\\\\nfrom overseas, by abolishing the 20% going rate salary discount for shortage occupations.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Stopped immigration from undercutting British workers, by increasing the salary threshold for Skilled Worker visas by 48% to £38,700.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Ensured those sponsoring dependants can support them financially, by raising the minimum income for family visas to £38,700.\\\\n\\\\nGoing forward, we will raise the Skilled Worker threshold and Family income requirement with inflation automatically to make sure they don’t undercut UK workers.\\\\n\\\\nWe have taken steps to ensure those coming to the UK do not place a burden on the NHS, by requiring them to pay the Immigration Health Surcharge and increasing this to £1,035. We will go further, in line with other countries, by requiring migrants to undergo a health check in advance of travel and increasing their Immigration Health Surcharge or requiring them to buy health insurance if they are likely to be a burden on the NHS.\\\\n\\\\nWe will increase all visa fees and remove the student discount to the Immigration Health Surcharge to raise more money for public services.\\\\n\\\\nWe will continue to attract the brightest and best students to study in our world class institutions. We will ensure those who come here are able to integrate into communities and participate in the economy. We want to make sure our immigration system is fair and will continue delivering the Windrush Compensation Scheme. We are committed to the EU Settled Status Scheme and the rights it has guaranteed for EU citizens.\\\\n\\\\nOur plan to cut migration We need to control numbers and give the public confidence they will come down significantly.\\\\n\\\\n❱ We will introduce a binding, legal cap on migration, set on work and family visas so public services are protected whilst we bring the skills our businesses and the NHS needs.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Our cap will be set at a level that explicitly takes into account the costs and the benefits of migration.' metadata={'source': 'local'}\"}], 'temperature': 1, 'n': 1, 'stream': False, 'max_tokens': 512, 'extra_body': {}}'\n",

Reoffending has fallen from over 30% in 2010 to 25%. We have recruited 20,000 police officers, delivered 6,000 prison places as part of the largest prison expansion since the Victorian era and deported over 18,000 foreign national offenders since 2019 alone. We will:\\\\n\\\\n❱ Give every neighbourhood an additional police officer by recruiting 8,000 more police officers to patrol communities and catch criminals in every ward in the country. These full time, fully warranted officers will be dedicated to neighbourhood policing.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Back the police, by giving officers new\\\\n\\\\npowers and tools to catch criminals, including technology like facial recognition and powers to seize knives and track down stolen property.

We will legislate to ensure officers are appropriately vetted during their service and those who fail can be sacked.\\\\n\\\\nWe will foster greater collaboration between the National Crime Agency and Counter Terrorism Policing.\\\\n\\\\nWe will urgently introduce Martyn’s Law, in tribute to Martyn Hett, who was tragically killed alongside 21 others in the Manchester\\\\n\\\\n44\\\\n\\\\nArena terrorist attack in 2017. This will ensure premises are better prepared for terrorist attacks by requiring them to take proportionate steps to mitigate risks.\\\\n\\\\nWe will toughen up community sentencing by increasing the use of community payback and electronic tagging, so criminals pay their debt to society and communities witness justice being served. We will fund every police force to roll out Hotspot Policing, which has cut anti-social behaviour by up to 50% in some areas.\\\\n\\\\nWe will keep turning the tide against fraudsters. In the last year we have reduced fraud by 13%, including through our new National Fraud Squad with 400 officers now in post. We will ban SIM farms, which are used to send bulk messages for fraudulent texts, and ban cold calls on financial products so fraudsters cannot dupe people into buying fake investments.\\\\n\\\\nTackling violence against women and girls\\\\n\\\\nWe have made violence against women and girls a strategic policing requirement for the first time, making clear to the police that these crimes are as significant as terrorism, serious and organised crime and child sexual abuse.\\\\n\\\\nWe have strengthened the law to punish predators with new offences for stalking, controlling or coercive behaviour, non-fatal strangulation and suffocation, sharing of intimate images or ‘revenge porn’, non-consensual taking of images of a woman breastfeeding, ‘up skirting’ and raised the maximum penalties for harassment. We will legislate to create new offences for spiking, the creation of sexualised deepfake images and taking intimate images without consent.\\\\n\\\\nWe will support victims of domestic abuse including through our Domestic Abuse Act, which created a statutory definition of domestic abuse and gave new powers to police and the courts.\\\\n\\\\nWe will toughen sentencing for murders that take place within the context of domestic abuse with new aggravating factors, such as if they involve coercive and controlling behaviour or gratuitous attacks. We will introduce a 25-year prison term for domestic murders, regardless of whether a weapon is used. Those who kill their domestic abusers will not face the same starting point.

The cost of renewables such as wind and solar has fallen dramatically. We will ensure the annual policy costs and levies on household energy bills are lower in each year of the next Parliament than they were in 2023.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Reforming the Climate Change Committee, giving it an explicit mandate to consider cost to households and UK energy security in its future climate advice.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Ruling out creating further green levies, and alongside our commitment not to introduce road pricing schemes, we will also rule out any frequent flyer levy.\\\\n\\\\nEnergy bills are falling, down 63% since the peak. We will take further action to ensure they are low as possible for families, by:\\\\n\\\\n❱ Maintaining our energy price cap,\\\\n\\\\nprotecting millions of households from being overcharged by their supplier. As the energy market advances, the price cap will need to evolve and we will ensure the regulator has the necessary powers to continue protecting consumers.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Reviewing and reforming standing\\\\n\\\\ncharges to keep them as low as possible.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Delivering our Pumpwatch scheme that will force petrol retailers to share live information on their prices, helping drivers to get a fair price at the pump.\\\\n\\\\n50\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nIntroducing more efficient local markets for electricity, which expert analysis estimates would save £20 - £45 per household per year.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Giving households the choice of smart\\\\n\\\\nenergy tariffs, which can save them £900 a year.\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nImplementing the recommendations of the Winser Review, ensuring networks are able to buy forward with confidence and cutting waiting times to get a grid connection to deliver an estimated saving of £15 - £25 per household per year out to 2035.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Recognising technological developments over the last decade, we will undertake a rapid review into the advantages of alternative network technologies, compared to overhead pylons. The review will consider moving to a presumption in favour of undergrounding where cost competitive.\\\\n\\\\nAlmost half of homes in England are now energy efficiency Band C, up from just one in seven in 2010. We will invest £6 billion in energy efficiency over the next three years to make around a million homes warmer. And we will fund an energy efficiency voucher scheme, open to every household in England, to support the installation of energy efficiency measures and solar panels, helping families lower their bills.\\\\n\\\\nWe will ensure democratic consent for onshore wind, striking the right balance between energy security and the views of their local communities. Our updated National Planning Policy Framework seeks to ensure local areas that host onshore wind directly benefit, including potentially through energy bill discounts.\\\\n\\\\nWe will support solar in the right places, not on our best agricultural land. We have changed planning rules to protect the best agricultural land with a presumption that this is used for food production, while also making it easier for solar to be located on brownfield sites and on rooftops. Our new planning rules also prevent multiple solar farms being clustered in one area to help protect our rural landscapes. We will retain the current moratorium on fracking.\\\\n\\\\nThe Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2024\\\\n\\\\nOur plan to build more houses in the right places\\\\n\\\\n51\\\\n\\\\nWe will deliver a secure future\\\\n\\\\nfor communities by giving more people a better chance of living where they would like – near their family, friends and job. We have delivered over 2.5 million homes since 2010, including meeting our commitment to deliver one million homes in the last Parliament. Home ownership rates plummeted under the last Labour Government so we cannot afford to go back to square one. We will deliver 1.6 million homes in England in the next Parliament by: ❱ Abolishing the legacy EU ‘nutrient\\\\n\\\\nneutrality’ rules to immediately unlock the building of 100,000 new homes with local consent, with developers required in law to pay a one-off mitigation fee so there is no net additional pollution.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Delivering a record number of homes each year on brownfield land in urban areas. We will do this by providing a fast- track route through the planning system for new homes on previously developed land in the 20 largest cities. Strong design codes will ensure this enables the gentle densification of urban areas, with new family homes and mansion-blocks on tree- lined streets built in the local character. We will look at extending ‘full expensing’ to the delivery of brownfield housing.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Raising density levels in inner London to those of European cities like Paris and Barcelona. We will ensure the London Plan delivers more family homes a year, forcing the Mayor to plan for more homes on brownfield sites, like underused industrial land. We will regenerate major sites like Euston, Old Oak Common and Thamesmead.\\\\n\\\\n52\\\\n\\\\n❱ Unlocking new urban regeneration\\\\n\\\\nschemes, by creating locally-led urban development corporations in partnership with the private sector and institutional investors. We will support the delivery of new quarters in Leeds, Liverpool and York alongside working with local leaders and the community to seize the opportunity of our ambitious Cambridge 2050 plan.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Supporting local and smaller builders by requiring councils to set land aside for them and lifting Section 106 burdens on more smaller sites, while ruling out Labour’s proposed ‘community right to appeal’ which would bring the planning system to its knees.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Making sure local authorities use the new Infrastructure Levy to deliver the GP surgeries, roads and other local infrastructure needed to support homes. We will not allow these funds to be spent on community projects that bear no relation to support for new homes.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Renewing the Affordable Homes\\\\n\\\\nProgramme that will deliver homes of all tenures and focus on regenerating and improving housing estates.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Retaining our cast-iron commitment to\\\\n\\\\nprotect the Green Belt from uncontrolled development, while ensuring more homes get built where it makes sense, like in inner cities. Our national planning protections mean there is never any top-down requirement for councils to remove Green Belt protection and these will remain in place.\\\\n\\\\nA plan to support first-time buyers onto the housing ladder and ensure fairness in our housing system\\\\n\\\\nAs well as building the homes we need, we will also take immediate steps to support more people onto the housing ladder. We will ensure the majority of first-time buyers pay no Stamp Duty at all, lowering the upfront costs of buying a first home. We will make permanent the increase to the threshold at which first-time buyers pay Stamp Duty to £425,000 from £300,000, which we introduced in 2022. We will also launch a new and improved Help to Buy scheme to provide first-time buyers with an equity loan of up to 20% towards the cost of a new build home. First-time buyers will be able to get onto the housing ladder with a 5% deposit on interest terms they can afford. The scheme will be part funded by contributions from house builders. We will also continue our Mortgage Guarantee Scheme, which has already helped over 40,000 households buy a home, while supporting more families to buy through shared ownership.\\\\n\\\\nTo further support homeowners, we will introduce a two-year temporary Capital Gains Tax relief for landlords who sell to their existing tenants. We rule out Labour’s anti-aspiration move to drastically reduce Right to Buy discounts to levels seen under the last Labour Government. We will protect the laws that ensure the discounts rise with inflation and fight any plan by local authorities to abolish the Right to Buy altogether.\\\\n\\\\nWe will complete the process of leasehold reform, to improve the lives of over four million leaseholders. We will cap ground rents at £250, reducing them to peppercorn over time. We will end the misuse of forfeiture so leaseholders don’t lose their property and capital unfairly and make it easier to take up commonhold.\\\\n\\\\nWe will pass a Renters Reform Bill that will deliver fairness in the rental market for landlords and renters alike. We will deliver the court reforms necessary to fully abolish Section 21 and strengthen other grounds for landlords to evict private tenants guilty of anti-social behaviour.\\\\n\\\\nWe will always prioritise giving those who work hard and contribute to our country a leg up in the housing market. We will legislate for new ‘Local Connection’ and ‘UK Connection’ tests for social housing in England, to ensure this valuable but limited resource is allocated fairly. And we will implement a ‘three strikes and you’re out’ expectation of social housing landlords for anti-social behaviour.

The cost of renewables such as wind and solar has fallen dramatically. We will ensure the annual policy costs and levies on household energy bills are lower in each year of the next Parliament than they were in 2023.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Reforming the Climate Change Committee, giving it an explicit mandate to consider cost to households and UK energy security in its future climate advice.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Ruling out creating further green levies, and alongside our commitment not to introduce road pricing schemes, we will also rule out any frequent flyer levy.\\\\n\\\\nEnergy bills are falling, down 63% since the peak. We will take further action to ensure they are low as possible for families, by:\\\\n\\\\n❱ Maintaining our energy price cap,\\\\n\\\\nprotecting millions of households from being overcharged by their supplier. As the energy market advances, the price cap will need to evolve and we will ensure the regulator has the necessary powers to continue protecting consumers.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Reviewing and reforming standing\\\\n\\\\ncharges to keep them as low as possible.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Delivering our Pumpwatch scheme that will force petrol retailers to share live information on their prices, helping drivers to get a fair price at the pump.\\\\n\\\\n50\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nIntroducing more efficient local markets for electricity, which expert analysis estimates would save £20 - £45 per household per year.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Giving households the choice of smart\\\\n\\\\nenergy tariffs, which can save them £900 a year.\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nImplementing the recommendations of the Winser Review, ensuring networks are able to buy forward with confidence and cutting waiting times to get a grid connection to deliver an estimated saving of £15 - £25 per household per year out to 2035.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Recognising technological developments over the last decade, we will undertake a rapid review into the advantages of alternative network technologies, compared to overhead pylons. The review will consider moving to a presumption in favour of undergrounding where cost competitive.\\\\n\\\\nAlmost half of homes in England are now energy efficiency Band C, up from just one in seven in 2010. We will invest £6 billion in energy efficiency over the next three years to make around a million homes warmer. And we will fund an energy efficiency voucher scheme, open to every household in England, to support the installation of energy efficiency measures and solar panels, helping families lower their bills.\\\\n\\\\nWe will ensure democratic consent for onshore wind, striking the right balance between energy security and the views of their local communities. Our updated National Planning Policy Framework seeks to ensure local areas that host onshore wind directly benefit, including potentially through energy bill discounts.\\\\n\\\\nWe will support solar in the right places, not on our best agricultural land. We have changed planning rules to protect the best agricultural land with a presumption that this is used for food production, while also making it easier for solar to be located on brownfield sites and on rooftops. Our new planning rules also prevent multiple solar farms being clustered in one area to help protect our rural landscapes. We will retain the current moratorium on fracking.\\\\n\\\\nThe Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2024\\\\n\\\\nOur plan to build more houses in the right places\\\\n\\\\n51\\\\n\\\\nWe will deliver a secure future\\\\n\\\\nfor communities by giving more people a better chance of living where they would like – near their family, friends and job. We have delivered over 2.5 million homes since 2010, including meeting our commitment to deliver one million homes in the last Parliament. Home ownership rates plummeted under the last Labour Government so we cannot afford to go back to square one. We will deliver 1.6 million homes in England in the next Parliament by: ❱ Abolishing the legacy EU ‘nutrient\\\\n\\\\nneutrality’ rules to immediately unlock the building of 100,000 new homes with local consent, with developers required in law to pay a one-off mitigation fee so there is no net additional pollution.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Delivering a record number of homes each year on brownfield land in urban areas. We will do this by providing a fast- track route through the planning system for new homes on previously developed land in the 20 largest cities. Strong design codes will ensure this enables the gentle densification of urban areas, with new family homes and mansion-blocks on tree- lined streets built in the local character. We will look at extending ‘full expensing’ to the delivery of brownfield housing.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Raising density levels in inner London to those of European cities like Paris and Barcelona. We will ensure the London Plan delivers more family homes a year, forcing the Mayor to plan for more homes on brownfield sites, like underused industrial land. We will regenerate major sites like Euston, Old Oak Common and Thamesmead.\\\\n\\\\n52\\\\n\\\\n❱ Unlocking new urban regeneration\\\\n\\\\nschemes, by creating locally-led urban development corporations in partnership with the private sector and institutional investors. We will support the delivery of new quarters in Leeds, Liverpool and York alongside working with local leaders and the community to seize the opportunity of our ambitious Cambridge 2050 plan.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Supporting local and smaller builders by requiring councils to set land aside for them and lifting Section 106 burdens on more smaller sites, while ruling out Labour’s proposed ‘community right to appeal’ which would bring the planning system to its knees.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Making sure local authorities use the new Infrastructure Levy to deliver the GP surgeries, roads and other local infrastructure needed to support homes. We will not allow these funds to be spent on community projects that bear no relation to support for new homes.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Renewing the Affordable Homes\\\\n\\\\nProgramme that will deliver homes of all tenures and focus on regenerating and improving housing estates.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Retaining our cast-iron commitment to\\\\n\\\\nprotect the Green Belt from uncontrolled development, while ensuring more homes get built where it makes sense, like in inner cities. Our national planning protections mean there is never any top-down requirement for councils to remove Green Belt protection and these will remain in place.\\\\n\\\\nA plan to support first-time buyers onto the housing ladder and ensure fairness in our housing system\\\\n\\\\nAs well as building the homes we need, we will also take immediate steps to support more people onto the housing ladder. We will ensure the majority of first-time buyers pay no Stamp Duty at all, lowering the upfront costs of buying a first home. We will make permanent the increase to the threshold at which first-time buyers pay Stamp Duty to £425,000 from £300,000, which we introduced in 2022. We will also launch a new and improved Help to Buy scheme to provide first-time buyers with an equity loan of up to 20% towards the cost of a new build home. First-time buyers will be able to get onto the housing ladder with a 5% deposit on interest terms they can afford. The scheme will be part funded by contributions from house builders. We will also continue our Mortgage Guarantee Scheme, which has already helped over 40,000 households buy a home, while supporting more families to buy through shared ownership.\\\\n\\\\nTo further support homeowners, we will introduce a two-year temporary Capital Gains Tax relief for landlords who sell to their existing tenants. We rule out Labour’s anti-aspiration move to drastically reduce Right to Buy discounts to levels seen under the last Labour Government. We will protect the laws that ensure the discounts rise with inflation and fight any plan by local authorities to abolish the Right to Buy altogether.\\\\n\\\\nWe will complete the process of leasehold reform, to improve the lives of over four million leaseholders. We will cap ground rents at £250, reducing them to peppercorn over time. We will end the misuse of forfeiture so leaseholders don’t lose their property and capital unfairly and make it easier to take up commonhold.\\\\n\\\\nWe will pass a Renters Reform Bill that will deliver fairness in the rental market for landlords and renters alike. We will deliver the court reforms necessary to fully abolish Section 21 and strengthen other grounds for landlords to evict private tenants guilty of anti-social behaviour.\\\\n\\\\nWe will always prioritise giving those who work hard and contribute to our country a leg up in the housing market. We will legislate for new ‘Local Connection’ and ‘UK Connection’ tests for social housing in England, to ensure this valuable but limited resource is allocated fairly. And we will implement a ‘three strikes and you’re out’ expectation of social housing landlords for anti-social behaviour. They will be expected to evict tenants whose behaviour is disruptive to neighbours and the local community.\\\\n\\\\nWe will protect family homes from higher tax. Under the Family Home Tax Guarantee, we will not increase the number of council tax bands, undertake an expensive council tax revaluation or cut council tax discounts, as Labour is currently doing in Wales. We will maintain Private Residence Relief so that people’s homes are protected from Capital Gains Tax and we will not increase the rate or level of Stamp Duty to support homeowners.\\\\n\\\\nWe will continue with our plans to end rough sleeping and prevent people from ending up on the streets in the first place, after making significant progress over the last few years.

Conservatives are committed to delivering stronger communities and safer streets, unleashing the power of the private sector to unlock jobs and opportunity for all and boosting local pride. We have already allocated and will ensure we deliver over £15 billion in dedicated levelling up funding across the UK since 2019 and passed our landmark Levelling Up and Regeneration Act. We have saved more than 330 pubs, sports clubs, arts venues and other precious community spaces through our Community Ownership Fund and we have unlocked the promise of thousands of jobs with 12 Freeports. To further strengthen communities, we will: ❱ Provide 105 towns in the UK with a £20\\\\n\\\\nmillion endowment fund for local people to change their town’s future. This includes extending our plan to 30 more towns who will benefit from funding that they can use on their priorities such as reviving high streets or bringing new housing to town centres.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Extend our Community Ownership Fund to help more communities across the UK take control of vital community assets like pubs, music venues, libraries, green spaces, leisure centres and more.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Extend the UK Shared Prosperity Fund for three years at the next Spending Review, before using this funding to support UK- wide National Service. Both schemes will\\\\n\\\\n56\\\\n\\\\ninvolve funding community groups focused on increasing life chances, instilling civic pride and boosting people’s skills.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Create more Freeports and Business\\\\n\\\\nRates Retention zones. Freeports have already generated just under £3 billion in investment, which in turn will create thousands of jobs. We will extend this opportunity to more areas and set out an application round in the next Parliament. We want to replicate the example of Sunderland’s Crown Works Studios elsewhere in the country. We will enable councils to retain all business rates growth within a defined zone for 25 years, which they can use to finance the delivery of new infrastructure and invest in supporting burgeoning local industries.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Continue backing Investment Zones across the country, giving areas £160 million to catalyse local growth and investment.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Give our high streets a new lease of\\\\n\\\\nlife and restore pride in place. We will change planning laws to support places to bring back local market days and regenerate defunct shopping centres. We will continue to make industry pay for removing chewing-gum from streets and raise the fines utility firms must pay when they create ‘street scars’ by not properly restoring roads and pavements after their works are completed. We will make fly tipping an offence that carries penalty points against your driving licence.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Empower communities through devolution and new powers. By 2030, every part of England that wants one will have a devolution deal. We will offer our ‘level 4’ devolution powers to areas in England with a devolution deal and a directly elected leader, starting with the Tees Valley.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Launch a Seaside Heritage Fund to support enhancements to our seaside heritage, preserving and restoring our coastal assets.\\\\n\\\\nWe will ensure councils provide high quality and value for money services to local communities. As part of this, we will protect residents from excessive council tax rises by ensuring that local people have the final say on council tax; and we will ban the ‘four-day working week’ in local authorities. We will improve standards in councils by making their performance more transparent through the Office for Local Government. We will always stand behind councils and look to recognise the unique circumstances of coastal areas in the allocation of grant funding to local authorities, alongside providing fairer funding for rural areas through the Rural Services Delivery Grant.\\\\n\\\\nA plan to support the journeys people make every day\\\\n\\\\nReliable transport links are critical for thriving local communities. The £36 billion of savings from HS2 will transform local and regional transport, benefitting more people, in more places, more quickly. But we will also take immediate steps to help people now. Buses are overwhelmingly the most popular form of public transport, in both urban and rural areas. Our £2 bus fare has cut bus fares outside London by 6.2%. We will extend the £2 bus fare cap in England for the entirety of the next Parliament, benefitting young people and low-income households while pensioners continue to benefit from the free bus pass. The extension of the £2 fare cap will be funded by savings from reform of the railway which will save up to £1.5 billion annually.\\\\n\\\\nBacking drivers In our first King’s Speech, we will go even further and introduce a Backing Drivers Bill that will:\\\\n\\\\n❱ Stop road pricing. A Conservative Government will not introduce\\\\tpay\\\\tper\\\\tmile\\\\troad\\\\tpricing\\\\tand\\\\twill\\\\tban\\\\tMayors\\\\t and local councils from doing so.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Reverse Labour’s unfair ULEZ expansion in London. Sadiq Khan’s ULEZ tax rise only has a ‘moderate’ or ‘minor’ effect on pollution. The expansion impacts thousands of people living around London who had no say in his election and can now no longer afford to get to hospital appointments or where they work or study. We will reverse it.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Rule out top-down blanket Low Traffic\\\\n\\\\nNeighbourhoods and 20mph zones. While 20mph zones can help improve road safety in residential areas or outside schools, misuse undermines public trust and risks congestion and pollution. We are clear they must only be considered on a road-by-road basis and with the support of people who live there. We will require any new schemes to be put to a referendum and introduce a ‘right to challenge’ existing Low Traffic Neighbourhoods and 20mph schemes.\\\\n\\\\nToo often over the last few years, local Labour politicians have made the journeys on which people rely harder. We are determined to turn this situation around. Since 2010, the Conservative Government has consistently been on the side of drivers. We have prioritised freezes in Fuel Duty and recently published our ‘Plan for Drivers’ including reforms to make better use of bus lanes, introduce penalties for overrunning street works and implement a consistent approach to the enforcement of entering yellow box junctions. Following the recent consultation, we will allow motorcycles in all bus lanes and reform motorcycle licensing.\\\\n\\\\nWe will roll out the National Parking Platform this year to simplify paying for parking. Reflecting feedback from older and disabled people, we will also give councils the power to ban pavement parking, provided they engage with businesses and residents to ensure they are not adversely affected.\\\\n\\\\nWe remain steadfastly committed to road safety and, to that end, will maintain our pledge to build no new smart motorways and invest in improving the safety of existing ones.\\\\n\\\\n57\\\\n\\\\n2025 marks the 200th anniversary of the first passenger railway in the UK and we are the only party with a credible plan for rail reform. Labour’s incoherent and ideological nationalisation plan would put the trade unions in charge, continuing to prolong unaffordable and unfair working practices which are unjustifiable to the public.\\\\n\\\\nWe will introduce a Rail Reform Bill in our first King’s Speech to create Great British Railways (GBR), headquartered in Derby. GBR will usher in a revitalised private-public partnership, delivering a modern and innovative railway with reliable services, and simpler tickets. We will task GBR with growing the role of the private sector, including supporting the expansion of open access services to bring greater choice for passengers. We will also look to include measures to reform outdated working practices in the rail industry in the Rail Reform Bill.\\\\n\\\\nOver the next Parliament, we will also roll out mobile pay as you go contactless tickets nationwide, bringing rail into line with how we pay for many goods and services.\\\\n\\\\nWe will work with Active Travel England to make it safer for people to walk or cycle, including projects like ensuring safe walking routes to schools and measures to protect pedestrians, cyclists and other vulnerable road users. Where new schemes are introduced, we will ensure they have local support first. While we back responsible cyclists, we will bring penalties for the rare instances where dangerous cyclists kill or injure into line with those for other road users.\\\\n\\\\n58\\\\n\\\\nProtecting our heritage and institutions' metadata={'source': 'local'}\"}], 'temperature': 1, 'n': 1, 'stream': False, 'max_tokens': 512, 'extra_body': {}}'\n",

We will create more places in children’s homes while prioritising keeping families together where that’s best for the child through our Kinship Care Strategy and helping children grow up in loving adoptive families where that is a better option. We will also support those leaving care with housing, education and employment, in addition to expanding befriending and mentoring programmes for care leavers.\\\\n\\\\nCutting tax for families\\\\n\\\\nIn April, we raised the threshold at which individuals begin to lose Child Benefit from £50,000 to £60,000 and halved the rate at which it is withdrawn. This is the right thing for families and the right thing for the economy.\\\\n\\\\nBut it still isn’t fair that single earner households can start losing their Child Benefit when a household with two working parents and a much higher total income can keep it in full. We will end this unfairness by moving to a household rather than individual basis for Child Benefit. So nobody is worse off than under the current system, we will set the combined household income at which a family will start losing Child Benefit at £120,000 and gradually remove it until household income reaches £160,000, above which families will no longer receive Child Benefit. This will benefit over 700,000 households, each gaining an average of £1,480 a year.\\\\n\\\\nProtecting children online\\\\n\\\\nDigital technology is a force for good.

We also know that the number of children suffering from mental illness is rising dramatically and children spend less time playing, sleeping and socialising.\\\\n\\\\nIn the last decade, we have done more to protect children online than any other country. From next year, our Online Safety Act will make it a legal requirement for social media firms to protect children from illegal or harmful content online. This includes fining social media companies who shirk their responsibilities to keep children safe.\\\\n\\\\nBut we need to do more to protect young people and empower parents to make decisions in the best interests of their children.\\\\n\\\\nWe will put our guidance on banning mobile phones in the school day on a statutory footing which will require all schools to operate a ban, as the best schools already do. We will provide funding for schools to help them ban mobile phones where they need it.\\\\n\\\\nWe will urgently consult on introducing further parental controls over access to social media. We know this is a complex area and we need more effective age verification and parental controls. That’s why we will consult widely to get this right, including developing the necessary technology, in partnership with other countries who are considering similar measures. We expect to build on the existing responsibilities set out for social media companies under the Online Safety Act.\\\\n\\\\n19\\\\n\\\\n20\\\\n\\\\nThe Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2024\\\\n\\\\nOur plan to get more people into work and build a fairer welfare system\\\\n\\\\n21\\\\n\\\\nWe believe in fairness and the value of hard work. Alongside a tax system that rewards work, we want a welfare system which supports everyone to fulfil their potential and live dignified and independent lives. There should always be a safety net for those who need it most; but those who can work to support themselves, should work, and they should be better off for doing so.\\\\n\\\\nSince 2010, we have delivered transformational reforms to put work at the heart of our welfare system. We have rolled out Universal Credit and cut its taper rate by 10p in the pound to make work pay. We’ve brought discipline to the system through tougher sanctions and conditionality. We introduced the household benefit cap and the two-child limit to make the system fairer to the taxpayers who pay for it and ensure benefits are always a safety net, not a lifestyle choice.\\\\n\\\\nAll of this has delivered near record levels of employment and low unemployment, with around four million more people in work since we came to office.\\\\n\\\\nAt the same time, we have protected the most vulnerable, safeguarding millions of jobs through the pandemic and delivering unprecedented support to help households through the energy shock from Putin’s war.\\\\n\\\\nSince the pandemic, new challenges have emerged. The number of people who are economically inactive due to ill health has risen from 2 million to 2.8 million, with a significant increase in mental health conditions among younger people. As a result, the number of working age people claiming benefits is projected to grow at an unsustainable rate, with all the wasted human potential that entails.\\\\n\\\\n22\\\\n\\\\nWe are now spending £69 billion a year on benefits for people of working age with a disability or health condition, a figure which has risen by two thirds since the pandemic. By the end of the decade, that spending is projected to increase to £90 billion. It would be irresponsible not to take bold action to put the welfare system on a sustainable footing.\\\\n\\\\nSo we will reform the system to make it fairer and more sustainable, unlocking the potential of millions of people and giving them the support they need to get into work.\\\\n\\\\nThis next generation of welfare reforms will build a system fit for the post-pandemic world. They will give everyone who can the best possible chance of returning to work, while providing the right support to those who need it. With fewer people moving onto welfare and more people in work fulfilling their potential, we will save taxpayers £12 billion a year. To deliver this, we will take a two-pronged approach.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, to address the unsustainable rise in benefit claims for people of working age with a disability or health condition, we will:\\\\n\\\\n❱ Reform our disability benefits so they\\\\n\\\\nare better targeted and reflect people’s genuine needs, while delivering a step- change in mental health provision. We will improve PIP assessments to provide a more objective consideration of people’s needs and stop the number of claims from rising unsustainably. While people suffering with mental health conditions face significant challenges, it is not clear that they always face the same additional living costs as people with physical disabilities. We will look at the best way to provide support, including whether treatment or services could be more appropriate for some people than a monthly cash payment, while also delivering a dramatic expansion in mental health support. At the same time, we will make the assessment process simpler and fairer for those with the most severe conditions.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Tighten up how the benefits system assesses capability for work. People are now three times more likely to be assessed as not fit for any work and put on the highest tier of sickness benefits than they were a decade ago. We will change the assessments from September 2025 so that those with more moderate mental health issues or mobility problems who could potentially engage with the world of work are given tailored support, instead of being written off on benefits. The OBR has forecast that these reforms will reduce the number of people on these benefits by 424,000.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Overhaul the fit note process so that\\\\n\\\\npeople are not being signed off sick as a default. Currently, 94% of fit notes are being signed off as ‘not fit for work’. We will design a new system which moves the responsibility for issuing fit notes away from our hard-pressed GPs towards specialist work and health professionals, and we will test integrating this with the new WorkWell service to provide tailored support to help people stay in or get back to work.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Accelerate the rollout of Universal Credit to ensure it always pays to work. We will move all of those remaining on outdated legacy benefits onto Universal Credit, removing disincentives for them to work and ensuring they will always be better off in work.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Continue to clamp down on fraudsters. Since 2019 we have delivered cumulative scored savings of £7.7 billion through measures we have taken to tackle fraud in the welfare system. Despite this, the level of welfare fraud remains far too high, having more than doubled during the pandemic. To deliver further savings, we will maintain our zero-tolerance approach to fraud. This will include a new Fraud Bill to give DWP powers similar to that of HMRC, so we can treat benefit fraud like we do tax fraud with new powers to identify, investigate and pursue fraudsters.\\\\n\\\\nWe hugely value the work that unpaid carers do supporting their loved ones. We have increased Carer’s Allowance by almost £1,500 since 2010 and given employees who are also unpaid carers entitlement to a period of unpaid leave. We will continue to stand behind our carers.\\\\n\\\\nSecond, to make sure that being on benefits remains a safety net, not a lifestyle choice, we will:\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nIntroduce tougher sanctions rules so people who refuse to take up suitable jobs after 12 months on benefits can have their cases closed and their benefits removed entirely. We will bring forward the new claimant review point for the long-term unemployed from 18 months to 12 months. At the claimant review, Work Coaches will set renewed conditions for claimants. If they fail to accept or comply with those conditions, such as refusing a suitable job or a mandatory work placement, their claim will be closed and their benefits will stop.\\\\n\\\\nThe vast majority of parents work incredibly hard to give their children the best start in life, but sadly a small number shirk their responsibilities. We will reform the Child Maintenance Service to prevent non- compliance and new laws to help crack down on non-payment. We’ll also look at how the Service can better support victims of domestic or economic abuse, building on recommendations from Dr Samantha Callan’s 2023 Independent Review.' metadata={'source': 'local'}\"}], 'temperature': 1, 'n': 1, 'stream': False, 'max_tokens': 512, 'extra_body': {}}'\n",

We will also support those leaving care with housing, education and employment, in addition to expanding befriending and mentoring programmes for care leavers.\\\\n\\\\nCutting tax for families\\\\n\\\\nIn April, we raised the threshold at which individuals begin to lose Child Benefit from £50,000 to £60,000 and halved the rate at which it is withdrawn. This is the right thing for families and the right thing for the economy.\\\\n\\\\nBut it still isn’t fair that single earner households can start losing their Child Benefit when a household with two working parents and a much higher total income can keep it in full. We will end this unfairness by moving to a household rather than individual basis for Child Benefit. So nobody is worse off than under the current system, we will set the combined household income at which a family will start losing Child Benefit at £120,000 and gradually remove it until household income reaches £160,000, above which families will no longer receive Child Benefit.

We will implement our planned reforms to cap social care costs from October 2025.\\\\n\\\\nWe will invest in more and better facilities, continuing to deliver 40 new hospitals by 2030 and investing proportionately more in out-of-hospital services over time. We will modernise NHS primary care services and bring health and care closer to patients.\\\\n\\\\nOur Dental Recovery Plan will unlock 2.5 million more NHS dental appointments, through a patient premium to encourage dentists to take on new NHS patients. We will make further reforms to the dental contract to ensure its future sustainability and we will ensure newly qualified dentists have to work in the NHS for a number of years or pay back their training costs. We will promote good oral health through our ‘Smile for Life’ programme. Rural and coastal communities will be better served through ‘golden hellos’ to encourage dentists to work in these areas, and through new dental vans.\\\\n\\\\nWe will further improve access to NHS services across England by training more staff in rural and coastal areas. For the first time the NHS Constitution will reflect the bespoke healthcare needs of rural and coastal communities and the need for the NHS to tailor services accordingly.\\\\n\\\\nWe will protect and promote patients’ right to choose the NHS service that is right for them. We will grow opportunities for all types of providers - NHS, charity or independent sector - to offer services free of charge to NHS patients, where these meet NHS costs and standards. We will extend patients’ right to choose to more NHS community services over time, including diagnostics, talking therapies and other mental health services. We will fully roll out Martha’s Rule, giving patients the right to a second opinion.\\\\n\\\\nWe will support our world-leading life sciences sector, embracing the opportunities provided by Brexit to pursue nimble and agile regulation, supported by a well-equipped MHRA. We will support research into new treatments, including for Parkinson’s and motor neurone disease and\\\\n\\\\nsecure more commercial clinical trials. We will remove bureaucratic obstacles to the use of new medicines, such as the NHS Budget Impact Test and will align NHS England’s cost-effectiveness thresholds for new medicines indications with those used by NICE. We will implement a new medtech pathway so that cost-effective medtech, including AI, is rapidly adopted throughout the NHS.\\\\n\\\\nWe will cut waste and bureaucracy in the NHS, reducing the number of managers by 5,500, releasing £550 million for frontline services and simplifying and streamlining oversight and accountability. We will carefully consider the implications of the review of the whistleblowing framework for the NHS and we will consult on a disbarring regime for NHS managers.\\\\n\\\\nTransforming NHS technology and productivity We will invest £3.4 billion in new technology to transform the NHS for staff and for patients.

We will take forward the NHS Vaccination Strategy.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Create new incentives for improved performance, rewarding the best performing providers of care.\\\\n\\\\nWe are implementing the HIV Action Plan, which will end new HIV transmissions by 2030. Subject to evaluation, we will expand HIV opt-out testing in emergency departments in England.\\\\n\\\\n41\\\\n\\\\nWe will prioritise women’s health, following publication of the first ever Women’s Health Strategy in 2022. To support women further, we will:\\\\n\\\\n❱ Bring forward a comprehensive\\\\n\\\\nnational strategy for maternity care as recommended by the APPG on Birth Trauma’s inquiry.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Deliver additional funding for maternal safety and improve access to mental health services for new mums, improve perinatal pelvic health services to prevent and support women with birth injuries and postnatal appointments dedicated to checking mums, not just their babies.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Expand women’s health hubs so that every integrated care system has at least one hub up and running.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Roll out fracture liaison services to every region, reaching 100% coverage by 2030 as osteoporosis disproportionately impacts women.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Support continued research into disparities in maternity care through the National Institute for Health and Care Research.\\\\n\\\\nWe will complete the implementation of the Cass Review, protecting young people questioning their gender from ideologically- driven care and ensuring that NHS services follow evidence-based best practice. We have already stopped the routine use by the NHS of puberty blockers for gender dysphoria and will legislate to permanently prevent their private prescription and supply.\\\\n\\\\nWe will amend the NHS Constitution so that it recognises every patient’s right to request single-sex accommodation and same-sex intimate care. We will not allow the word ‘woman’ to be erased by health services. Words such as ‘breastfeeding’ and ‘mother’ will not be replaced by ‘chestfeeding’ and ‘birthing parent’.\\\\n\\\\nWe will introduce a new licensing scheme and age limits for non-surgical cosmetic procedures, ensuring services are administered by suitably qualified and trained professionals.\\\\n\\\\n42' metadata={'source': 'local'}\"}], 'temperature': 1, 'n': 1, 'stream': False, 'max_tokens': 512, 'extra_body': {}}'\n",

We will modernise NHS primary care services and bring health and care closer to patients.\\\\n\\\\nOur Dental Recovery Plan will unlock 2.5 million more NHS dental appointments, through a patient premium to encourage dentists to take on new NHS patients. We will make further reforms to the dental contract to ensure its future sustainability and we will ensure newly qualified dentists have to work in the NHS for a number of years or pay back their training costs. We will promote good oral health through our ‘Smile for Life’ programme. Rural and coastal communities will be better served through ‘golden hellos’ to encourage dentists to work in these areas, and through new dental vans.\\\\n\\\\nWe will further improve access to NHS services across England by training more staff in rural and coastal areas. For the first time the NHS Constitution will reflect the bespoke healthcare needs of rural and coastal communities and the need for the NHS to tailor services accordingly.\\\\n\\\\nWe will protect and promote patients’ right to choose the NHS service that is right for them. We will grow opportunities for all types of providers - NHS, charity or independent sector - to offer services free of charge to NHS patients, where these meet NHS costs and standards. We will extend patients’ right to choose to more NHS community services over time, including diagnostics, talking therapies and other mental health services. We will fully roll out Martha’s Rule, giving patients the right to a second opinion.\\\\n\\\\nWe will support our world-leading life sciences sector, embracing the opportunities provided by Brexit to pursue nimble and agile regulation, supported by a well-equipped MHRA. We will support research into new treatments, including for Parkinson’s and motor neurone disease and\\\\n\\\\nsecure more commercial clinical trials. We will remove bureaucratic obstacles to the use of new medicines, such as the NHS Budget Impact Test and will align NHS England’s cost-effectiveness thresholds for new medicines indications with those used by NICE. We will implement a new medtech pathway so that cost-effective medtech, including AI, is rapidly adopted throughout the NHS.\\\\n\\\\nWe will cut waste and bureaucracy in the NHS, reducing the number of managers by 5,500, releasing £550 million for frontline services and simplifying and streamlining oversight and accountability. We will carefully consider the implications of the review of the whistleblowing framework for the NHS and we will consult on a disbarring regime for NHS managers.\\\\n\\\\nTransforming NHS technology and productivity We will invest £3.4 billion in new technology to transform the NHS for staff and for patients. The NHS Productivity Plan will see NHS productivity grow by 1.9% a year from 2025-26 – unlocking £35 billion of cumulative savings by the end of the decade. We will:\\\\n\\\\nWe know that, for most people, poor health comes from living with one or more of six major health conditions: cancer, heart disease, musculoskeletal disorders, mental ill-health, dementia and respiratory disease. We will publish and implement a Major Conditions Strategy to prevent these conditions from occurring and ensure those living with them receive the best possible care. We will also take forward our Rare Diseases Action Plan. We will continue to modernise autism and learning disability services.\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\t Make\\\\tthe\\\\tNHS\\\\tApp\\\\tthe\\\\tsingle\\\\tfront\\\\tdoor\\\\tfor\\\\tNHS\\\\n\\\\nservices. Patients will use the App to access their medical records, order prescriptions, book vaccine appointments, access a digital red book and manage their hospital appointments.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Use AI to free up doctors’ and nurses’ time for frontline\\\\n\\\\npatient care.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Replace tens of thousands of outdated computers,\\\\n\\\\nWe will bring forward our landmark Tobacco and Vapes Bill in our first King’s Speech. We will continue to tackle childhood and adult obesity and will legislate to restrict the advertising of products high in fat, salt and sugar. We will gather new evidence on the impact of ultra- processed food to support people to make healthier choices.\\\\n\\\\nslashing the 13 million hours in doctors’ and nurses’ time lost to IT issues every year and digitise NHS processes through the Federated Data Platform.\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\t Fund\\\\ttechnology\\\\tto\\\\thelp\\\\tclinicians\\\\tread\\\\tMRI\\\\tand\\\\tCT\\\\n\\\\nscans more quickly and accurately, speeding up results for 130,000 patients every year.\\\\n\\\\nWe will roll out new digital health checks to 250,000 more people every year, helping to prevent hundreds of strokes and heart attacks. We will take forward the NHS Vaccination Strategy.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Create new incentives for improved performance, rewarding the best performing providers of care.\\\\n\\\\nWe are implementing the HIV Action Plan, which will end new HIV transmissions by 2030. Subject to evaluation, we will expand HIV opt-out testing in emergency departments in England.\\\\n\\\\n41\\\\n\\\\nWe will prioritise women’s health, following publication of the first ever Women’s Health Strategy in 2022. To support women further, we will:\\\\n\\\\n❱ Bring forward a comprehensive\\\\n\\\\nnational strategy for maternity care as recommended by the APPG on Birth Trauma’s inquiry.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Deliver additional funding for maternal safety and improve access to mental health services for new mums, improve perinatal pelvic health services to prevent and support women with birth injuries and postnatal appointments dedicated to checking mums, not just their babies.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Expand women’s health hubs so that every integrated care system has at least one hub up and running.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Roll out fracture liaison services to every region, reaching 100% coverage by 2030 as osteoporosis disproportionately impacts women.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Support continued research into disparities in maternity care through the National Institute for Health and Care Research.\\\\n\\\\nWe will complete the implementation of the Cass Review, protecting young people questioning their gender from ideologically- driven care and ensuring that NHS services follow evidence-based best practice. We have already stopped the routine use by the NHS of puberty blockers for gender dysphoria and will legislate to permanently prevent their private prescription and supply.\\\\n\\\\nWe will amend the NHS Constitution so that it recognises every patient’s right to request single-sex accommodation and same-sex intimate care. We will not allow the word ‘woman’ to be erased by health services. Words such as ‘breastfeeding’ and ‘mother’ will not be replaced by ‘chestfeeding’ and ‘birthing parent’.\\\\n\\\\nWe will introduce a new licensing scheme and age limits for non-surgical cosmetic procedures, ensuring services are administered by suitably qualified and trained professionals.\\\\n\\\\n42' metadata={'source': 'local'}\"}], 'temperature': 1, 'n': 1, 'stream': False, 'max_tokens': 512, 'extra_body': {}}'\n",

Attempts at so-called ‘conversion therapy’ are abhorrent. But legislation around conversion practices is a very complex issue, with existing criminal law already offering robust protections. The challenges involved can be seen, for example, with the SNP re-consulting for views on their proposals in Scotland and Sweden recently concluding that they will not be pursuing a similar ban. In light of the Cass Review Final Report, it is right that we take more time before reaching a final judgement on additional legislation in this area.\\\\n\\\\nIt has been more than a decade since the Equality Act was passed by a Labour Government.

The next Conservative Government will introduce primary legislation to clarify that the protected characteristic of sex in the Equality Act means biological sex. This will guarantee that single sex services and single sex spaces can be provided, for example in healthcare and sports settings, to ensure women and girls are protected. We are clear that on fundamental matters of personal identity there should be one approach across the country, so we will also legislate so that an individual can only have one sex in the eyes of the law in the United Kingdom.\\\\n\\\\nEquality of opportunity\\\\n\\\\nWe are committed to promoting equality of opportunity, not divisive identity politics.

Our Inclusive Britain plan advances opportunity while tackling unfair ethnic disparities across education, employment, health and the justice system. We are seeing some of the most entrenched disparities in our society narrowing, for example in our justice system and our police forces, we now have the highest proportion of ethnic minority officers, judges and magistrates since records began.\\\\n\\\\nIn recent years, an increasing number of children have started questioning their gender, the consequences of which are still unknown.

In the last Parliament, we maintained the farming budget to support our food security. In England, this has supported farmers with a range of options to choose what works best for them, from business advice to new equipment, soil and nutrient management and hedgerow planting. Labour’s actions in Wales show that they will never be on the side of the farming community. Their blueprint involves top-down targets, fundamentally denying farmers the flexibility they need to achieve environmental goals in ways that work for them and making their primary job of keeping the nation fed harder. Conservatives will always be on the side of farmers.\\\\n\\\\nTo continue backing our farmers, we will:\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nIncrease the UK-wide farming budget by £1 billion over the Parliament, ensuring it rises by inflation in every year. Farmers will be able to spend every extra penny on grants to boost domestic food production on top of maintaining our approach to Environmental Land Management Schemes. In England, nearly half of all farmers have now signed up to schemes, choosing what works best for their business to invest in food security and sustainable agriculture. We will build on work to date to ensure our schemes work for all farmers, from tenants to the uplands and beyond.\\\\n\\\\n62\\\\n\\\\n❱ Continue to ringfence agricultural funding so it is passed directly on to farming and rural communities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland alongside a new UK-wide £20 million Farming Innovation Fund.\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nIntroduce a legally binding target to enhance our food security. The target will apply UK-wide alongside our UK Food Security Index, the first of its kind, helping us to determine where best to concentrate farming funds. This will also feed into the development of the Land Use Framework.\\\\n\\\\n❱\\\\n\\\\nImprove public sector procurement to deliver our goal that at least 50% of food expenditure is spent on food produced locally or to higher environmental production standards.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Reform our planning system to deliver fast track permissions for the building of infrastructure on farms, such as glasshouses, slurry and grain stores, and small-scale reservoirs.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Use our significant investment in R&D to\\\\n\\\\nprioritise cutting-edge technology in areas such as fertiliser and vertical farming.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Stick to our plan to support the agricultural sector with the labour it needs to maintain our food security, while moving away from the reliance on seasonal migrant labour with a five-year visa tapered scheme, alongside clear investment in automation and promoting agri-food careers and skills.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Always stand up for farmers when\\\\n\\\\nnegotiating new trade deals. At the 2023 UK Farm to Fork Summit, an event which we will continue every year, we set out our commitments to ensure UK farming is at the heart of UK trade.

In 2024, we secured quotas worth over £970 million for UK fishermen. We will go further to seek additional opportunities for our inshore fleet in the 2026 negotiations, and ensure inshore voices are better heard by their representative bodies.\\\\n\\\\nWe will replicate the £100 million UK Seafood Fund to continue to support the sector to thrive. The fund could be used to invest in harbour and fish market upgrades, provide new equipment and technology for fish processing or to support our growing aquaculture sector. We will particularly concentrate funding on small and medium sized businesses and the inshore fishing fleet. Recognising competing pressure on marine space, we will also seek opportunities to back the inshore fleet when making marine planning decisions.\\\\n\\\\n63\\\\n\\\\n64\\\\n\\\\nThe Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2024\\\\n\\\\nOur plan to support our rural way of life and enhance our environment\\\\n\\\\n65\\\\n\\\\nConservatives are committed to nurturing a thriving rural economy. Rural areas already contribute over £250 billion to the economy. We will build on this, supporting jobs, growth and education in rural communities.\\\\n\\\\nOver 80% of properties across the country can now access high-speed broadband, up from just 7% in 2019, with a record £714 million committed to boosting rural broadband coverage in 2024. We will invest in new technology to achieve our ambitious broadband targets for hard-to-reach areas. On transport, the £2 fare cap has cut rural bus fares by over 11% and our commitment in our Backing Drivers Bill not to introduce pay per mile road pricing schemes will ensure people who rely on their cars in rural areas are protected.\\\\n\\\\nWe will do more to boost the availability of affordable housing for local people in rural areas. We will ensure rural exception sites support local people into home ownership and create a dedicated taskforce in Homes England to deliver on the mission set out in their Rural Housing Statement to invest in regeneration and building high quality homes. We will ensure councils have the powers they need to manage the uncontrolled growth of holiday lets, which can cause nuisance to residents and a broader ‘hollowing out’ of communities.\\\\n\\\\nConservatives will always seek to preserve and enhance the rural way of life. We will make no changes to the Hunting Act. Further, public arms-length bodies must be responsive to those they serve. Rural communities are clear that improvements must be made to the ways in which these bodies consult and make decisions, especially from Natural England and the Environment Agency. We will improve their accountability and give them clearer objectives to focus on. They must take balanced decisions and factor in the impact on the rural economy.\\\\n\\\\nIn recent years we have seen increasingly extreme wet weather, underlining the\\\\n\\\\n66\\\\n\\\\nimportance of building flood resilience. Since 2010, Government investment has better protected over 600,000 properties from flooding and coastal erosion, and since 2015, has protected over 900,000 acres of farmland. In 2020, we announced a doubling of capital funding into flood defences in England to a record £5.6 billion over 2021-2027. We will maintain this record flooding funding to continue to protect homes, farms and businesses. This will work alongside the Flood Recovery Framework and Farming Recovery Fund to directly support communities, businesses and farmers affected by flooding.\\\\n\\\\nEnhancing nature and protecting our environment\\\\n\\\\nOur beautiful countryside, coastline, woods and rivers are a crucial part of what makes our country so special. We are committed to leaving the environment in a better state for future generations. We introduced our landmark Environment Act including ambitious targets to halt nature’s decline by 2030 and Biodiversity Net Gain, a world leading scheme to deliver greener new development. We led international efforts to protect our oceans and seas, building on the success of the Blue Belt programme which protects an area of ocean the size of India. We will consult UK overseas territories on opportunities to expand it further.\\\\n\\\\nWe will continue with our moratorium on deep sea mining and will ratify the Global Oceans Treaty early in the next Parliament. We have prioritised animal welfare, passing legislation to protect pets from harm whilst ensuring owners are responsible and cracking down on dangerous dogs such as XL Bullies. We remain committed to banning the import of hunting trophies and tackling puppy smuggling and livestock worrying.\\\\n\\\\nWater supply interruptions to customers have decreased five-fold and leakage has been cut by one-third since privatisation. Last year 90% of our designated bathing waters were\\\\n\\\\nclassified as ‘good’ or ‘excellent’, up from 76% in 2010. But we must go further. That is why we set out an ambitious Plan for Water, bringing historic levels of transparency and investment, while keeping bill increases affordable for consumers. Our plan includes:\\\\n\\\\n❱ Working with the regulator to further hold companies to account, including banning executive bonuses if a company has committed a serious criminal breach. This will build on our legislation for unlimited fines.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Extending the £50 water rebate for those in the South West across the Parliament.\\\\n\\\\nurban greening, focused on the new quarters we want to develop in Leeds, Cambridge and sites in inner London.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Cut red tape that holds back the planting of trees in the planning system. This will identify particularly suitable areas for tree planting where processes and permits will be streamlined.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Deliver our commitment at COP28 to introduce forest risk commodities legislation early in the next Parliament, tackling our impact on illegal deforestation internationally.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Using fines from water companies to invest in river restoration projects, including linking up thriving habitats to multiply the benefits for wildlife and water quality. This will create a river recovery network, modelled on our nature recovery network, and create new destinations for people to enjoy across England.

In 2024, we secured quotas worth over £970 million for UK fishermen. We will go further to seek additional opportunities for our inshore fleet in the 2026 negotiations, and ensure inshore voices are better heard by their representative bodies.\\\\n\\\\nWe will replicate the £100 million UK Seafood Fund to continue to support the sector to thrive. The fund could be used to invest in harbour and fish market upgrades, provide new equipment and technology for fish processing or to support our growing aquaculture sector. We will particularly concentrate funding on small and medium sized businesses and the inshore fishing fleet. Recognising competing pressure on marine space, we will also seek opportunities to back the inshore fleet when making marine planning decisions.\\\\n\\\\n63\\\\n\\\\n64\\\\n\\\\nThe Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2024\\\\n\\\\nOur plan to support our rural way of life and enhance our environment\\\\n\\\\n65\\\\n\\\\nConservatives are committed to nurturing a thriving rural economy. Rural areas already contribute over £250 billion to the economy. We will build on this, supporting jobs, growth and education in rural communities.\\\\n\\\\nOver 80% of properties across the country can now access high-speed broadband, up from just 7% in 2019, with a record £714 million committed to boosting rural broadband coverage in 2024. We will invest in new technology to achieve our ambitious broadband targets for hard-to-reach areas. On transport, the £2 fare cap has cut rural bus fares by over 11% and our commitment in our Backing Drivers Bill not to introduce pay per mile road pricing schemes will ensure people who rely on their cars in rural areas are protected.\\\\n\\\\nWe will do more to boost the availability of affordable housing for local people in rural areas. We will ensure rural exception sites support local people into home ownership and create a dedicated taskforce in Homes England to deliver on the mission set out in their Rural Housing Statement to invest in regeneration and building high quality homes. We will ensure councils have the powers they need to manage the uncontrolled growth of holiday lets, which can cause nuisance to residents and a broader ‘hollowing out’ of communities.\\\\n\\\\nConservatives will always seek to preserve and enhance the rural way of life. We will make no changes to the Hunting Act. Further, public arms-length bodies must be responsive to those they serve. Rural communities are clear that improvements must be made to the ways in which these bodies consult and make decisions, especially from Natural England and the Environment Agency. We will improve their accountability and give them clearer objectives to focus on. They must take balanced decisions and factor in the impact on the rural economy.\\\\n\\\\nIn recent years we have seen increasingly extreme wet weather, underlining the\\\\n\\\\n66\\\\n\\\\nimportance of building flood resilience. Since 2010, Government investment has better protected over 600,000 properties from flooding and coastal erosion, and since 2015, has protected over 900,000 acres of farmland. In 2020, we announced a doubling of capital funding into flood defences in England to a record £5.6 billion over 2021-2027. We will maintain this record flooding funding to continue to protect homes, farms and businesses. This will work alongside the Flood Recovery Framework and Farming Recovery Fund to directly support communities, businesses and farmers affected by flooding.\\\\n\\\\nEnhancing nature and protecting our environment\\\\n\\\\nOur beautiful countryside, coastline, woods and rivers are a crucial part of what makes our country so special. We are committed to leaving the environment in a better state for future generations. We introduced our landmark Environment Act including ambitious targets to halt nature’s decline by 2030 and Biodiversity Net Gain, a world leading scheme to deliver greener new development. We led international efforts to protect our oceans and seas, building on the success of the Blue Belt programme which protects an area of ocean the size of India. We will consult UK overseas territories on opportunities to expand it further.\\\\n\\\\nWe will continue with our moratorium on deep sea mining and will ratify the Global Oceans Treaty early in the next Parliament. We have prioritised animal welfare, passing legislation to protect pets from harm whilst ensuring owners are responsible and cracking down on dangerous dogs such as XL Bullies. We remain committed to banning the import of hunting trophies and tackling puppy smuggling and livestock worrying.\\\\n\\\\nWater supply interruptions to customers have decreased five-fold and leakage has been cut by one-third since privatisation. Last year 90% of our designated bathing waters were\\\\n\\\\nclassified as ‘good’ or ‘excellent’, up from 76% in 2010. But we must go further. That is why we set out an ambitious Plan for Water, bringing historic levels of transparency and investment, while keeping bill increases affordable for consumers. Our plan includes:\\\\n\\\\n❱ Working with the regulator to further hold companies to account, including banning executive bonuses if a company has committed a serious criminal breach. This will build on our legislation for unlimited fines.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Extending the £50 water rebate for those in the South West across the Parliament.\\\\n\\\\nurban greening, focused on the new quarters we want to develop in Leeds, Cambridge and sites in inner London.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Cut red tape that holds back the planting of trees in the planning system. This will identify particularly suitable areas for tree planting where processes and permits will be streamlined.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Deliver our commitment at COP28 to introduce forest risk commodities legislation early in the next Parliament, tackling our impact on illegal deforestation internationally.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Using fines from water companies to invest in river restoration projects, including linking up thriving habitats to multiply the benefits for wildlife and water quality. This will create a river recovery network, modelled on our nature recovery network, and create new destinations for people to enjoy across England. It will take a more local, tailored approach like the plan for the River Wye.\\\\n\\\\nWe know that spending time outdoors in nature can significantly benefit our health and wellbeing, especially for children.

In London, despite the high profile hiring of a ‘Night Czar’ by the Labour Mayor, over 3,000 pubs, bars and nightclubs have closed in the capital since March 2020. We will turn this around by launching a review of the nighttime economy in England, looking at how to reverse the decline in pubs and clubs and how to make our towns and cities great places to go out.\\\\n\\\\nThe BBC should represent the perspectives of the entire nation with diversity of thought, accuracy and impartiality as its guiding principles.

The United Kingdom is a unique and uniquely successful Union, enabling each constituent part to grow and thrive. As the Conservative and Unionist Party, we are committed to supporting our Union and continuing to deliver for people across the UK.\\\\n\\\\nDuring the 25th anniversary year of devolution, we celebrate the progress which has been made and the relationships which have been built. We are focused on working together to deliver for people across the UK, including maintaining meaningful intergovernmental relations. Since the initial devolution settlements, significant further powers have been devolved to Holyrood, Cardiff Bay and Stormont. We believe governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland now have the right balance of powers to deliver for people there.\\\\n\\\\nAs powers have been transferred, it has become more important than ever that the devolved governments are held responsible for their performance. To support this, we will legislate to deliver comparable data across the UK so the performance of public services can be accurately compared.\\\\n\\\\nWe support greater accountability within the devolved parliaments and centralisation within Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to ensure decisions are made as close to the communities they serve as possible. Devolved governments should be focused on utilising the powers they have to deliver on people’s priorities and we will continue to oppose attempts to distract from these with constitutional wrangling.\\\\n\\\\nWe will relentlessly protect the UK’s internal market, securing Northern Ireland’s place in it\\\\n\\\\n72\\\\n\\\\nand protecting consumers and businesses from unnecessary trade barriers. Intra-UK trade is worth £190 billion, and to boost this, we have legislated to guarantee unfettered access for goods from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK and will establish a new Intertrade UK body to promote trade within the United Kingdom. The UK Internal Market Act ensures businesses can sell goods and provide services freely across the UK.\\\\n\\\\nLevelling up across the UK\\\\n\\\\nDelivering for people right across the country requires joint working between the UK and devolved governments as well as local partners. Our focus on delivery and working with local partners to do so, has paid dividends in recent years, providing:\\\\n\\\\n❱ over £3 billion of investment in levelling up\\\\n\\\\nin Scotland;\\\\n\\\\n❱ over £2.5 billion to level up Wales; and\\\\n\\\\n❱ over £1 billion for levelling up projects in\\\\n\\\\nNorthern Ireland.\\\\n\\\\nThe UK Government has a duty to citizens right across the country. Over the course of the last Parliament we have been building stronger relationships with local authorities and community groups in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to help us deliver for people there. We are committed to continuing to fund projects across the UK directly and will:\\\\n\\\\n❱ Extend the UK Shared Prosperity Fund for another three years, delivering a further £540 million a year for communities across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Expand the Long-Term Plan for Towns,\\\\n\\\\nsupporting a further nine towns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland with £20 million endowments to make long-term improvements over 10 years.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Maintain the Community Ownership\\\\n\\\\nFund for another three years, enabling community groups across Scotland, Wales\\\\n\\\\nand Northern Ireland to continue accessing funding to save community assets which are at risk of being lost.\\\\n\\\\n❱ Continue the Multi-Sport Grassroots\\\\n\\\\nFacilities Programme throughout the next Parliament so sports facilities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can access vital investment.\\\\n\\\\nScotland\\\\n\\\\nTen years on from the 2014 independence referendum, the SNP remain focused on the constitution while Scotland has moved on.

We are also boosting Scotland’s economy through mechanisms such as our City and Growth Deals, dedicated British Business Bank fund and support for Scottish exports. Our new Intertrade UK body will promote trade within the United Kingdom, with 61% of Scotland’s exports going to the rest of the UK in 2021.\\\\n\\\\nWe will pursue the extension of the Enhanced Investment Zone to cover Stranraer and Cairnryan on the west coast of Scotland, recognising this vital route between Northern Ireland and Scotland and the opportunities for trade and economic growth.\\\\n\\\\nOur Islands Forum will also continue to bring together island communities from across the UK to consider and identify solutions to their unique needs.\\\\n\\\\nWe will press for the permanent removal of tariffs on Scotch whisky with the US Government and work to achieve a significant tariff reduction in India through free trade agreement discussions. Scottish businesses will also continue to benefit from measures including tax reliefs for creative industries, support for small businesses and entrepreneurs and the Global Britian Investment Fund.\\\\n\\\\nWe will prioritise our energy security. We have already put the Energy Security Investment Mechanism into legislation, ensuring the energy profits levy will end when oil and gas prices fall below a threshold. We will bring legislate to require annual oil and gas licensing rounds and maintain investment allowances for the oil and gas sector while supporting renewable technologies.\\\\n\\\\nWe will continue backing the North Sea Transition Deal and Aberdeen City Region Deal, with Aberdeen’s Investment Zone bringing £160 million of support to the area over the next ten years. We will focus on supporting Scotland’s workforce transition to new industries such\\\\n\\\\n73\\\\n\\\\nas carbon capture, offshore wind, hydrogen and tidal, including by providing £15 million to support the Energy Transition Zone’s skills programmes.

They further plan to implement Minimum Service Levels legislation to limit the impact of industrial action on public services.\\n\\nTax-cut strategies, described as funding sustainable debt and borrowing without causing a spike in inflation, are also outlined. The government plans to reduce National Insurance to 6% by April 2027 and eventually abolish it. They plan to abolish National Insurance for self-employed workers by the end of the next Parliament, claiming it will benefit a majority (93%) of the self-employed people. Furthermore, they promise not to raise the rate of income tax or VAT.\\n\\nIn efforts to increase pay for working people, a revision to the National Living Wage is proposed with an increase to £13 per hour; this combined with tax cuts is approximated to have increased the take-home pay by about 35% in real terms since 2010. For pensioners, a new Pensions Tax Guarantee has been introduced to refrain from imposing any new taxes. \\n\\nTo address tax avoidance and evasion, the government proposes measures anticipated to gain £6 billion per annum within the duration of Parliament.\\n\\nIn support of families, the largest ever expansion of childcare is presented, including access to free childcare hours for specific age groups, and wrapping up to potential savings for families estimated at £6,900 per annum. Their Family Hubs initiative has been implemented in over 75 local authorities and there are plans to expand to every local authority in England.\\n ; The document summarises several key initiatives designed to improve the experiences of children in social care, protect children online, and build a fairer welfare system. \\n\\nUnder social care, it highlights plans to create more places in children's homes, keep families together where best for the child, support those leaving care with housing, education and employment. It also plans to introduce befriending and mentoring programmes for leavers. \\n\\nIn addition, there are moves to address the unfair Child Benefit system. The threshold for Child Benefit withdrawal was raised from £50,000 to £60,000 in April, and plans are in place to move a household rather than individual basis for Child Benefit. This means combined household income begins withdrawal at £120,000 and entirely stops at £160,000. \\n\\nFor online safety, steps to protect children include a legal requirement for social media firms to protect children from harmful online content, a guidance on banning mobile phones during the school day, and more effective age verification strategies. The introduction of further parental controls over access to social media will also be consulted on. \\n\\nIn terms of welfare system, the document regards the welfare system as a support mechanism rather than a lifestyle choice. Achievements since 2010 include the implementation of Universal Credit and reforms that have led to record levels of employment. To meet new challenges post-pandemic and rising benefit claims due to ill health, there are plans to reform disability benefits, tighten the fit note process, rollout Universal Credit, clamp down on welfare fraud, and introduce tougher conditions for long-term unemployed benefits. Changes to the Child Maintenance Service are also addressed to ensure parents are responsible for their children. ; The Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2024 lays out the party's plans to improve educational opportunities and the skills of young people. Since 2010, the education system has seen a marked improvement with students in England performing better in reading and mathematics and outperforming peers in Labour-run Wales and SNP-run Scotland. The manifesto pledges to continue to build on this success by keeping school funding at its highest and increasing the number of teachers. Free school meals have been extended to more groups of children and an amount of almost £3 billion will be allocated next year to support disadvantaged children. The party thoroughly supports teachers while also implementing rules for better classroom behavior. \\n\\nTeachers will be supported and given incentives to retain them in schools, especially in priority areas.

There is also a commitment to transparency in education, giving parents the right to see what their children are taught in schools. \\n\\nThe manifesto speaks of the reinforcement of academies and independent schools while providing a supportive environment for children with special educational needs by creating additional school places. The party plans to reintroduce a modern, flexible model of National Service aimed to equip young people with valuable life skills.\\n\\nEmphasizing the importance of apprenticeships, the party claims to have delivered 5.8 million apprenticeships since 2010 and promises to create 100,000 more per year by the end of the next Parliament.

Other initiatives include funding for the National Citizen Service as well as the establishment of the Lifelong Learning Entitlement for adults to upskill throughout their working lives.\\n\\nIn terms of national security, the party commits to taking bold action to protect the UK amid global uncertainty.

There are plans to adapt defense strategy based on lessons learned from the war in Ukraine and invest in technology beneficial for modern warfare. Additionally, £10 billion is planned for munitions production, a majority of which will be spent within the UK over the next decade.\\n\\nSpecific provisions have been made for veterans, ensuring their rights are recognized in law and that their support and recognition are maintained, involving measures like maintaining the Office for Veterans Affairs and implementing a National Insurance holiday for those who employ veterans. \\n\\nThe government aims to ensure investment in defense maximizes economic performance and productivity, targeting to become the largest defense exporter in Europe by 2030. The UK government maintains its commitment to global engagement and economic collaboration, strengthening relationships with partners around the world, such as the US and Commonwealth partners. It will consistently engage with China where it aligns with UK interests while condemning human rights violations. \\n\\nFinally, the UK pledges to continue being one of the largest development donors globally, ensuring aid and development align with the country's strategic objectives. ; This document outlines multiple strategic international relations and immigration plans. \\n\\nFirstly, the document reveals intentions to maintain and strengthen relations in the Indo-Pacific region through the continued partnership with Australia, AUKUS, and the ASEAN dialogue.

They also contain an aim to attract high-skilled migrants and propose amendments to visa applications, intending to make the processes more stringent.\\n\\nFinally, the document highlights the government’s commitment to stand behind Israel’s right to defence and push for a two-state solution in the Middle East. Other outlined plans include aiding the diplomatic breakthroughs in countries such as Cyprus, Sri Lanka, Sudan, and Myanmar and restricting any public body from imposing their boycott or divestment campaigns against foreign countries and territories.\\n ; The document primarily discusses the plans and commitments of the Conservative and Unionist Party, as outlined in their 2024 manifesto.
